%		\noindent The study, situated in the context of water supply in Curitiba, focuses on the effectiveness of forecasting water demand in Bairro Alto from $2018$ to $2020$. The central question investigated is how to anticipate water demand for more efficient planning in the context of scarcity faced by the residents. The purpose of the work is to contribute to the effective control of water resources, utilizing forecasting models, with an emphasis on improving water supply in a competitive environment.
%		Models such as \textit{Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average} (ARIMA), \textit{Decision Tree} (DT), \textit{eXtreme Gradient Boosting} (XGBoost), and \textit{Recurrent Neural Network} (RNN) are explored for time series forecasting, with a comparative analysis of effectiveness. The need for a new or better solution arises from the water scarcity in Bairro Alto, justifying the search for more efficient methods of demand forecasting.
%		The proposed solution involves the application of machine learning models such as ARIMA, DT, XGBoost, and especially RNN in forecasting water demand. The basic methodology includes applying these models to the data collected by SANEPAR (Sanitation Company of Paraná).
%		The features responding to the initial questions are assessed through metrics such as \textit{Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error} (sMAPE), \textit{Mean Absolute Error} (MAE), and \textit{Root Relative Mean Square Error} (RRMSE), highlighting that the RNN model consistently demonstrated the lowest errors in all analyses. It is concluded that the proposed approach significantly contributes to water demand forecasting, providing a more efficient and sustainable planning of water supply in Bairro Alto.

\noindent This study, situated in the context of water supply in Curitiba, exemplifies a comprehensive approach to address the growing challenges of water demand. Focusing specifically on the effectiveness of demand forecasting in Bairro Alto, the primary objective is to ensure that the existing infrastructure can meet the continually growing needs of the population, avoiding issues of inadequate supply. The analysis of time series forecasting models is conducted to provide a precise analysis of water demand prediction.
Utilizing data collected by the Companhia de Saneamento do Paraná during the years $2018$ to $2019$, this study proposes a significant contribution to the effective control of water resources. The emphasis is on a variety of forecasting models, including Auto-Regressive, Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Inputs, Moving Average, Auto-Regressive Moving Average, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average , ARIMA with Exogenous Inputs, and Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Inputs.
In addition to these models, the study particularly highlights the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which consistently demonstrated the smallest errors in all analyses. Exploring forecast horizons of one hour ahead, six hours ahead, twelve hours ahead, and twenty-four hours ahead, the detailed results show the different performances of these models.
For 1-hour ahead forecasts, the RNN achieves a Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) of $0.1647$, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $0.0057$, and Root Relative Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of $0.0022$.
At the 6-hour ahead horizon, the RNN demonstrates an SMAPE of $0.1356$, MAE of $0.0046$, and RRMSE of $0.0022$, highlighting its accuracy in this time interval.
When considering 12-hour ahead forecasts, the RNN achieves an SMAPE of $0.1343$, MAE of $0.0046$, and RRMSE of $0.0021$, indicating its consistency in longer time horizons.
For 24-hour ahead projections, the RNN maintains remarkable performance with an SMAPE of $0.2231$, MAE of $0.0077$, and RRMSE of $0.0028$.
These results underscore the reliability of the RNN in water demand forecasting across different time scales, thereby providing efficient and sustainable water supply planning in the region.
