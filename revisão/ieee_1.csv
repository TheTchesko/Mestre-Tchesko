However, even when their main task is collecting data, there are challenges, such as working in unpredictable environments, which can affect the communication channel and sensors' functionalities, which could cause the loss of information. On the other hand, statistical and deep learning-based forecasting methods can fill in missing data. In this work, we investigate those forecasting algorithms to select the best one for different data measurements in a real-world setting, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2. Based on our results, the Holt-Winters methods were selected to forecast the temperature and CO2, and Long-Short-Term Memory was used to forecast humidity. These models were then trained in the Edge-scale servers to define their computational requirements and feasibility to be exported to a microcontroller.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3307072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10225693","Industrial Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;missing value filling;Artificial Intelligence.

The accurate prediction of passenger flow is not only beneficial but necessary to adjust public transportation systems. As such, metro passenger volume prediction has become a crucial issue in the realm of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this paper, a novel model called EWT-EnsemLSTM-LSSA has been proposed to deal with the complex issue of passenger flow prediction. This model assembles empirical wavelet transform (EWT), long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector regression (SVR), and logistic mapping sparrow search algorithm (LSSA) to create a comprehensive and robust solution. To start with, EWT is implemented to decompose the original dataset into five wavelet time-sequence data series for further prediction. A cluster of LSTMs with varying hidden layers and neuron counts is then deployed to scrutinize and exploit the implicit information within the EWT-decomposed signals. Subsequently, the output of LSTMs is integrated into a non-linear regression method SVR. Finally, LSSA is engaged to optimize the SVR automatically. The EWT-EnsemLSTM-LSSA model is put to the test in three case studies, employing data collected from the metro of Minneapolis, America, and Hangzhou, China. The results of these experiments are truly remarkable, as they indicate that the proposed model outperforms its conventional counterparts by reducing the mean average error to 189.27 and the root mean square error to 260.36 in Minneapolis data, and the mean average error to 24.97 and the root mean square error to 41.75 in Hangzhou data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3307184","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:no. 20ZR1402800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10225517","Traffic volume prediction;Time series analysis;Empirical wavelet transform (EWT);Long short term memory (LSTM);Support vector regression (SVR);logistic mapping Sparrow search algorithm (LSSA)","Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Logic gates;Computer architecture;Support vector machines;Microprocessors;Forecasting;Time series analysis;Wavelet transforms;Traffic control;Public transportation","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Of these, forecasting short-term load keeps track of activities on a daily, weekly, and hourly basis, which is becoming more popular since it reduces time and costs. While designing and implementing the electric power system, mid-term forecasting of the load is a critical stage in organizing, maintaining, and preparing for interruptions. On the basis of the Pearson correlation matrix, Machine learning models like support vector regression(SVR) and linear regression(LR), and deep learning, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP) approaches presented in this paper.

To address these issues, a lightweight single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) combining convolution mapping and time–frequency decomposition called CTFNet is proposed with three distinctive characteristics. First, time-domain (TD) feature mining—in this article, a method for extracting the long-term correlation of horizontal TD features based on matrix factorization is proposed, which can effectively capture the interdependence among different sample points of a long time series. Second, multitask frequency-domain (FD) feature mining—this can effectively extract different frequency feature information of time-series data from the FD and minimize the loss of data features. Integrating multiscale dilated convolutions, simultaneously focusing on both global and local context feature dependencies at the sequence level, and mining the long-term dependencies of the multiscale frequency information and the spatial dependencies among the different scale frequency information, break the bottleneck of data utilization, and ensure the integrity of feature extraction. Third, highly efficient—the CTFNet model has a short training time and fast inference speed.

Based on the transformer model, Crossformer utilizes cross-time dependencies and cross-dimension dependencies for multi-dimensional forecasting, which enhances the accuracy of traditional transformers for time series forecasting. Finally, we use the predicted multi-dimensional feature values with a regression model to achieve the remaining useful life prediction of PEMFC. Furthermore, we address the issue of non-stationarity in the original sequences by employing a two-stage normalization approach. Specifically, we perform normalization on each input sample and restore the predicted output results using the same statistical data to enhance data stationarity, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the model.

As power systems grow and get more complex, and with the deployment of more sensors and data collection capabilities, monitoring and analyzing data streams for outage prediction will get more complicated. In addition, the burden on human operators to analyze such data is getting challenging. Furthermore, climate change introduces new challenges to power grid reliability and makes the human grid operators’ task more critical. To address some of these challenges, this research proposes a novel model to jointly predict power grid outages and discover precursors from spatiotemporal data using multi-level data. The new method utilizes multi-task learning (MTL) and multi-instance learning (MIL) to jointly predict outages and learn event precursors. This is achieved by introducing distance-aware self-attention to capture relationships between locations and improve event detection and precursor discovery while utilizing multi-level data (local weather data, global demand, and forecast data) in a sparse setting. Experiments are conducted using five years of data collected in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The proposed methodology achieves an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AU-PRC) of 0.97 using 12 hours of data before the event. Experiments showed that the proposed model could predict events several hours ahead with high accuracy, where such early predictions allow grid operators to deploy outage mitigation plans. In addition, the new framework effectively discovers spatiotemporal precursors for power outages.

One of the solutions to reduce the throughput of 360° videos is to introduce the notion of field of view (FoV) which allows to transmit at a given time only a portion of the video with a higher quality. The remaining portions of the video will be transmitted with a lower quality. In this work, a lossy forecasting approach is proposed to predict the motion trajectory of users of a 360° streaming system in order to ensure better quality of experience (QoE). A new Time Series Forecasting approach using Classification (TSFC) that transforms real data into discrete data so that classification algorithms can be used to make forecasts from them.

Existing methods on time-series domain adaptation mainly follow the paradigm designed for static data, which cannot handle domain-specific complex conditional dependencies raised by data offset, time lags, and variant data distributions. In order to address these challenges, we analyze variational conditional dependencies in time-series data and find that the causal structures are usually stable among domains, and further raise the causal conditional shift assumption. Enlightened by this assumption, we consider the causal generation process for time-series data and propose an end-to-end model for the semi-supervised domain adaptation problem on time-series forecasting. Our method can not only discover the Granger-Causal structures among cross-domain data but also address the cross-domain time-series forecasting problem with accurate and interpretable predicted results. We further theoretically analyze the superiority of the proposed method, where the generalization error on the target domain is bounded by the empirical risks and by the discrepancy between the causal structures from different domains.

Induction of federation members may require some verifications and predictions related to capacity and capability of these members for compensating such types of workloads. However, the nature of federated services require stringent methods to keep track of dynamically forming resource clusters for forecasting their behavior. Recent literature has mostly focused on the applicability of forecasting algorithms based on static datasets with little or no applicability to real time scenarios. Proposed research has utilized a real world application of Clouds4Coordination (C4C) federation system. A resource forecasting strategy using two well-known algorithms, namely Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed for collaborative clouds used in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. The results have shown that no single algorithm is sufficient enough to deal with dynamic scenarios of cloud federation.

We introduce three graphical GARCH models: one symmetric Graph GARCH model and two asymmetric models namely Graph Exponential GARCH and Graph GJR-GARCH. Assuming that graph signals and their residuals are graph stationary, this framework can decompose the multivariate GARCH models into a linear combination of several univariate GARCH processes in the graph spectral domain. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of parameters with the graph topology information and further reduce the estimation cost by utilizing the principal components of the graph signal in the frequency domain. These proposed models are tested on synthetic data and on two real applications for weather prediction and wind power forecasting. With the data and GARCH model residuals being graph stationary, the experiment results demonstrate that these three graphical models can make multi-step predictions more accurately than non-graph GARCH models and Graph Vector Autoregressive Moving Average model.","2373-776X","","10.1109/TSIPN.2023.3304142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214355","Graph Signal Processing;Laplacian Matrix;Multivariate Time Series Forecasting;ARCH;GARCH;Multivariate GARCH;EGARCH;GJR-GARCH;O-GARCH","Autoregressive processes;Predictive models;Biological system modeling;Laplace equations;Covariance matrices;Time series analysis;Forecasting","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Hence, this paper proposes a new forecasting approach for medium-term electricity market prices based on an extreme learning machine-autoencoder (ELM-AE). The main idea behind this is to use trained weights for hidden layers instead of randomly generated weights. The input hidden layer weights are obtained by solving a network with the same input outputs by the autoencoder method. Then, the obtained output weights are used again as the input weights for a new ELM network. To do so, a data-set is created using input data, where the ahead 24 hours are forecasted based on the previous 168 data. The simulations have been performed on New York Independent System Operator prices and compared with the classic ELM demonstrating the high accuracy of the proposed method in both training and testing.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3303866","Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange through the Ulam Programme(grant numbers:BPN/ULM/2021/1/00227,PPN/ULM/2020/1/00196); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214317","Forecasting;electricity price;extreme learning machine;autoencoder;electricity market","Forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Time series analysis;Wind power generation;Wind forecasting;Training;Predictive models","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It has been a challenging scientific problem to map the spatial relationships between real-world entities such as roads, pedestrians, and cars more accurately into predictive models, while also taking into account the impact of time-varying factors such as weather and holidays on spatial relationships. To address this problem, a new traffic prediction model based on continuous temporal modules of graph neural networks is proposed in this paper(A Highly efficient Graph Attention Network Based on Temporal Block, T-EGAT), by combining the Highly efficient Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism (EMSA) with Gragh Neural Network (GNN), the data structure of the graph addresses the dependence of real-world roads on the spatial domain, and the continuous temporal function has replaced the traditional fixed-time compensated prediction window, allowing the prediction model to deal more effectively with bursts of events that occur within a short time, thus further reducing the dependence on the temporal domain.

Therefore, this paper aims to study the used sailboat market in Hong Kong and develop a mathematical model that can explain and predict the trading price of used sailboats to investigate the effect of regional effects on the trading price. In this paper, this work first pre-processed the data of sailboats by using VMD series decomposition to decompose the data containing time series and also used the XG-Boost model for data prediction, and the model can achieve a fit of over 95% in the training set, and the indicators of the model such as MAE and MAPE are also very accurate. In order to improve the accuracy of the model, this paper uses the SSA optimization method to optimize the catamaran price prediction model further and obtain a more accurate prediction model. Meanwhile, to discuss whether the regional effect is consistent on different sailboats, this paper verifies the regional effect with the help of the ANOVA method of the importance of indicator characteristics output from the XGB model. The results show that the area effect is essential and has a more significant impact on single-handed sailboats.

In wind integration studies, it is hence important to consider the need of balancing power caused by wind power. In this paper, we propose a new model to simulate minute resolution wind power time series in multi-area power systems, that allows for estimation of the additional need of reserves caused by wind power in future scenarios. The model is based on first simulating forecast uncertainty using a multidimensional autoregressive moving average model, and then simulating the variability by adding an autoregressive time series to a cubic spline interpolation. The model is found to generate scenarios of minute resolution wind power generation that are sufficiently realistic for long-term scenario studies. The model output can be used for analysing future reserve requirements or for scenario generation for stochastic optimisation of future power systems.","","978-1-6654-8778-8","10.1109/PowerTech55446.2023.10202966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202966","Wind power;Forecast error simulation;Minute resolution;Future scenarios;Power system reserves","Time series analysis;Stochastic processes;Wind power generation;Predictive models;Data models;Wind forecasting;Splines (mathematics)","","","","","","17","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Flexible Approach for Selection of the Training Set for ANN-Based Load Forecast Using Autoencoder and Similar Day Method","Z. Pajić; A.

The standard similar day forecast approach finds the best fit for the forecasted days' load based on the weather, load, or other factors. That approach is not accurate enough and finding the best fit excludes valuable information for the rest of the days in history. Moreover, if only the basic idea of this approach is used, only a narrow set of similar days is selected, which is unsuitable for ANN training. The general idea is to compare all days instead of choosing the best days. This approach provides a more flexible approach for selecting a proper training dataset for ANN. The proposed method uses an autoencoder to code all the days in history and enables comparison to the forecast day. The selection of the days is made using the Euclidian norm. The two vector distances between the forecast day code and the codes from the history are calculated using the Euclidian norm. Then the whole history is sorted by the value of the distance. Only the part with the most similar days of the initial set is used for training the ANN. Results on the test set showed that metrics improved when ANN is trained on similar days set that is selected using the proposed method. The proposed method determines enough days for the ANN training procedure and helps ANN to learn the correlation between load and other input factors optimally.","","978-1-6654-8778-8","10.1109/PowerTech55446.2023.10202813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202813","short-term load forecast;autoencoder;similar days;artificial neural network","Training;Measurement;Codes;Correlation;Load forecasting;Time series analysis;Weather forecasting","","","","","","14","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MM combines features from all-sky imagery and meteorological sensor data as two modalities to predict renewable power generation that otherwise could not be combined effectively. The combined, predicted values are then input to a differentiable optimal power flow (OPF) formulation simulating the energy management.

The BCS approach was chosen instead of the traditional compressed sensing (CS) due to its superiority in terms of signal recovery accuracy. In the prediction step, we consider three models namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), long short-term memory (LSTM), and forward neural networks (FNN).

We aim to utilize a data-driven approach to analyze integral parameters such as land surface temperature, ocean surface temperature, percentage change in temperature over the years etc., and use the inference as a basis to interpret the variations in climate policies/climate actions in tackling climate change. We leverage a network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – a popular deep learning model, for time-series forecasting of global temperature changes. This is coupled with a comprehensive analysis of the model’s predictions based on multiple data mining techniques. Comparison of the LSTM’s performance with the rolling mean baseline model shows that based on temperature changes, 19% of areas across the planet suffer from extreme climatic conditions. This affects the average temperature of the globe drastically.

As an important online predictive model, kernel adaptive filtering has attracted much attention over the past decade. The traditional kernel least mean square (KLMS) is derived based on minimizing the mean square error (MSE) criterion, which inevitably suffers from performance deterioration for nonlinear regression tasks corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. To this end, we in this paper propose a novel robust kernel adaptive filtering algorithm, namely robust variable step-size kernel normalized LMS (RVSS-KNLMS) algorithm. The fundamental idea of our design is to prevent large outliers from perturbing the model training by limiting the energy of the weight update within a dynamic threshold. By establishing the energy conservation relation, we perform a rigorous analysis of the mean square convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. This analysis allows us to derive a sufficient condition for determining the appropriate step-size. In addition, with the pre-tuned dictionary strategy which serves to simplify the nonlinear system model, we investigate the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) of the proposed algorithm and arrive at a closed-form solution for prediction. Simulations on synthetic data and real-world data have confirmed the advantages of RVSS-KNLMS. Moreover, the theoretical steady-state analysis has been validated to provide good prediction results.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3300416","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201475); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10209568","kernel adaptive filtering;non-Gaussian noise;energy conservation relation;steady-state EMSE;nonlinear regression","Kernel;Sensors;Filtering;Steady-state;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Adaptation models","","","","","","","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Inflation is a rise in price of the goods and services produced in a country. As a result of rising prices, a given amount of money can now buy fewer goods and services. The general public’s cost of living is affected by this loss of purchasing power, which ultimately slows economic growth. Thus, it has a negative impact on the purchasing power of the people. Various sorts of baskets of commodities are generated and tracked as price indices to calculate inflation or deflation, depending on the chosen set of goods and services used. One type of price index proposed in this project is Consumer Price Index (CPI), which looks at the weighted average of costs for a variety of products and services like transportation, food, and healthcare. This paper proposes different deep learning time series models such as LSTM, BiLSTM and hybrid ensemble learning to forecast the Indian consumer price index (CPI).

However, Non-stationarity and unpredictability make accurate forecasting difficult. Time series approaches are suitable for forecasting stationary time series derived from a non-stationary sequence. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) are time-domain decomposition methods used to separate the components of the original solar radiation time series that have distinct time1-scale characteristics. As a result, the components are forecasted using the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model, which is a simple and effective machine learning method. This paper presents a hybrid EMD/EEMD-BPNN model for predicting short-term solar irradiance. To identify unique data information at different time scales, EMD/EEMD first breaks up the solar radiation time series into several stationary or fundamental sub-series. The next step is to create BPNN models with specified parameters for each subsequence to forecast new ones. Finally, each subsequence's projected value is combined to generate the final forecast result. The accuracy of solar forecasts has greatly increased, especially when utilizing hybrid methods. Furthermore, using the proposed hybrid technique for multistep forecasting resulted in even more improvement. The basic BPNN model for 15 min time step achieves predicting with a root mean square error (RMSE) of roughly 416.04 W/m2 for 15min; however, this error decreases to 65.25 W/m2 with the EMD-Hybrid Model, and 32.86 W/m2 with the EEMD-Hybrid Model. In addition, the results of the skill score have proven clearly that EMD/EEMD-BPNN Model performs better compared to typical BPNN using several meteorological inputs","","979-8-3503-4743-2","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope57605.2023.10194879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194879","Solar radiation forecasting;Multiscale decomposition;Hybrid model;Neural network model","Radiation effects;Empirical mode decomposition;Time series analysis;Machine learning;Predictive models;Data models;Solar radiation","backpropagation;forecasting theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;power engineering computing;solar power;solar radiation;time series","accurate forecasting difficult;back propagation neural network model;basic BPNN model;BPNN models;EEMD-Hybrid Model;effective machine learning method;EMD-Hybrid Model;forecasting stationary time series;fundamental sub-series;hybrid EMD-EEMD-BPNN model;hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition;hybrid technique;machine learning techniques;multistep forecasting;nonstationary sequence;original solar radiation time series;power system usage;short-term solar irradiance prediction;short-term solar radiation forecasting;solar forecasts;stationary sub-series;time series approaches;time-domain decomposition methods;typical BPNN","","","","29","IEEE","3 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of their potential has been deployed in both electric loads and renewable energy sources (RES) production time series forecasting as a crucial support for power system planning. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to forecasting other time series of significant relevance for the power system, as is the case of the time series of power quality (PQ) indices. This situation strongly contrasts with the growing concern of the research community about the large number of PQ issues reported within the electric power system due to multiple causes (i.e., an increasing number of grid-connected RES and the proliferation of nonlinear loads) and with the importance of keeping these PQ indices under the limits reported by international standards to preserve the power system's stability. This research provides an exhaustive overview of the progress the research community has made over the use of DL in forecasting time series of PQ indices, showing that this discipline is far from being mature. Given this scenario, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed to forecast the steady state of several PQ indices time series which evaluate the current distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC) of a dwelling. The main contributions of this paper include the use of higher data granularity (l-minute of aggregation interval), the time series forecasting for both components of each current harmonic (real and imaginary components) to facilitate the harmonic mitigation task and the integration of the proposed model as a part of an internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to enable the online PQ indices time series forecasting and control over the energy resources.","","979-8-3503-4743-2","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope57605.2023.10194689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194689","Long short-term memory;power system harmonics;steady state power quality indices;time-series forecasting","Time series analysis;Power quality;Production;Power system stability;Power system harmonics;Harmonic analysis;Distortion","deep learning (artificial intelligence);distributed power generation;harmonic distortion;Internet of Things;power engineering computing;power supply quality;power system planning;recurrent neural nets;renewable energy sources;smart power grids;time series","current harmonic distortion time series forecasting;deep learning;electric loads;electric power system;internet of things;IoT;long short-term memory;LSTM-based network;machine learning;PCC;point of common coupling;power quality;power system planning;power system stability;RES;smart grid","","","","33","IEEE","3 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results show that the energy demand forecast provided by the CNN model outperforms the linear regression models as the former is able to accurately capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in buildings' load profiles, making it a suitable deep learning model for load forecast problems.","","979-8-3503-4743-2","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope57605.2023.10194711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194711","energy consumption;baseline estimation;deep learning;buildings;convolutional neural network","Deep learning;Load forecasting;Linear regression;Buildings;Estimation;Predictive models;Data models","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);demand forecasting;energy consumption;load forecasting;mean square error methods;power engineering computing;regression analysis;time series","actual predicting models;buildings;CNN model;data retrieval;deep learning convolutional neural network model;domestic demand;energy baseline estimation;energy consumption;energy demand;exploratory analysis;load forecast;machine learning;multivariable linear regression model;pilot sites;renewable generation;root mean squared error;steady electrification;time series;uni-variate linear regression model","","","","11","EU","3 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of data-driven approaches in system monitoring has led to significant improvements in health monitoring and anomaly detection. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the complex inter-sensor relationships present in satellites. They do not explicitly exploit the structure of these relationships to predict the expected behavior of telemetry time series either. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel health monitoring framework for artificial satellites that combines causal graphs and deep learning. In the causality learning phase, we propose a method that integrates mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) and PCMCI (Peter-Clark Momentary Conditional Independence) to construct an efficient and accurate causal discovery approach for learning causal graphs for high-dimensional telemetry data. Subsequently, we design a graph attention-based neural network that incorporates these causal graphs into a deep network for prediction. Experimental evaluation on two datasets from satellite attitude control systems and power systems demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method in accurately predicting health status compared to baseline approaches. Furthermore, the experiments highlight the interpretability-enhancing role of causal graphs, which is beneficial for health monitoring and anomaly detection.","2166-5656","979-8-3503-4625-1","10.1109/ICPHM57936.2023.10194125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194125","satellite health management;causal discovery;time series prediction;anomaly detection;health assessment","Analytical models;Satellites;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Sensor systems;Sensors;Telemetry","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;attitude control;causality;condition monitoring;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph neural networks;satellite telemetry;telemetry;time series","anomaly detection;artificial satellites;causal discovery approach;causal graph-based framework;causality learning phase;complex inter-sensor relationships;data-driven approaches;deep learning;graph attention-based neural network;health status monitoring;high-dimensional telemetry data;maximum relevance minimum redundancy;mRMR;PCMCI;Peter-Clark momentary conditional independence;power systems;satellite attitude control systems;satellite health monitoring;satellite operations;system monitoring;telemetry data forecasting;telemetry time series","","","","25","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Forecasting such MTSs with multiple external MTS factors needs to model both within and between MTS interactions and handle their uncertainty, heterogeneity, and dynamics. Existing shallow to deep MTS modelers, including regressors, deep recurrent neural networks such as DeepAR, deep state space models, and deep factor models, do not jointly characterize these issues in a probabilistic manner across MTSs. We propose an end-to-end deep probabilistic cross-MTS learning network MTSNet. MTSNet incorporates a tensor input with scaled target and external MTSs. It then vertically and horizontally stacks long-short memory networks for encoding and decoding target MTSs and enhances uncertainty modeling, generalization and forecasting robustness by residual connection, variational zoneout, and probabilistic forecasting. The tensor input is projected to a probability distribution for target MTS forecasting.

This last aspect, in particular, is of utmost relevance. Addressing it allows for coordinated planning and action by proper authorities with adequate anticipation. Aiming to solve this problem, we present a new framework that applies Machine Learning methods for: (1) climatic variables forecasting; and (2) forest fire risk classification. For the first objective, different time series forecasting algorithms were tested. The forecasted variables are then used as input for the second objective, for which different classification algorithms were also tested. We evaluated our proposal using Brazilian Pantanal regional biome data from 1999 to 2019, where climatic variables were collected from ground meteorological stations, and fire occurrences (hotspots) were obtained from satellite images. The experiments considered 4 climatic variables and 5 forest fire risk classes. The results were evaluated based on the average correlation between (i) the prediction of forest fire risk classes and (ii) the observation of hotspots.

Deep learning has shown great potential in recent years. Graph convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks and other deep learning architectures have been used in traffic forecasting. However, most existing methods capture spatial and temporal correlations sequentially or synchronously and couple spatial and temporal representations, which may introduce spurious dependencies. The heterogeneity of spatio-temporal data also increases the difficulty of modeling and makes it harder to obtain accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-branch spatial-temporal decoupling neural network (MBSTDN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we independently map hidden features into spatial and temporal representations and process them through corresponding branches to produce partial predictions. The partial predictions are then aggregated into final predictions by residual links. At the same time, we reconstruct input signals through a separate branch, introducing layer-by-layer decomposition based on residual learning to deal with the intricate dependencies. Furthermore, we design an embedding layer utilizing multi-dimensional information to reduce the influence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity on predictions. Experiments on four public traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MBSTDN which performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191710","traffic forecasting;graph convolutional network;spatio-temporal data;time series","Correlation;Recurrent neural networks;Convolution;Time series analysis;Transforms;Predictive models;Robustness","convolutional neural nets;data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph neural networks;neural net architecture;recurrent neural nets;spatiotemporal phenomena;traffic engineering computing","complex spatial correlations;deep learning architectures;graph convolutional networks;layer-by-layer decomposition;MBSTDN;multibranch spatial-temporal decoupling neural network;recurrent neural networks;residual learning;spatio-temporal heterogeneity;temporal correlations;temporal representations;traffic forecasting","","","","40","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate traffic flow forecasting is challenging due to the intricate spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data. Recently GNN-based and Transformer-based methods significantly improved the prediction accuracy. However, existing GNN-based methods struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Furthermore, existing Transformer-based methods treat traffic flow data as time series and extract temporal and spatial relationships separately. That will make the input series difficult to be processed by the Transformer without information loss and increase the computation time. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Spatio-Temporal Pre-training enhanced Fast Pure Transformer Network (STP-FPTN). First, the traffic flow data are split along the dimension of the sensor rather than the time dimension. After that, a pure Transformer-based model is designed for capturing complex and long-range spatio-temporal correlations simultaneously and quickly. Then, to enhance the ability of our model to extract spatio-temporal features, STP-FPTN utilizes unsupervised pre-training for intricate spatio-temporal patterns representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted with 4 real-world datasets and 19 baselines, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

To guarantee the accuracy and coherence simultaneously for the prediction, most of the classical methods tackle this problem with two-stage models, which may not obtain optimal predictions due to the complex computational process. Although the majority of end-to-end deep learning models were proposed to avoid the shortage of traditional methods, most existing works stack the shallow neural network directly which caused degradation issues possibly and decreased the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we draw on the idea of deep residual networks (ResNet) and the top-down method to form an end-to-end hierarchical decomposition residual network (HDResNet), which could decrease the computation cost of prediction and improve the forecasting outcome. For each block of our model, we firstly employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer and linear layer to obtain two decompositions, the residual forecasting and proportion forecasting. Then, a functional layer which is based on the top-down approach is proposed, to update the residual forecasting of children nodes and decrease the noise transmission. Moreover, considering the stability at different levels, a weighted loss function is proposed based on the coefficient of variation for each level. Through three public datasets, we prove that our model has a superior performance to the existing hierarchical forecasting models.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191455","hierarchical time series;multivariate time series;residual networks;top-down method","Degradation;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Neural networks;Predictive models;Stability analysis","deep learning (artificial intelligence);forecasting theory;recurrent neural nets;time series","classical methods;complex computational process;deep residual networks;end-to-end deep learning models;end-to-end hierarchical decomposition residual network;HDResNet;hierarchical forecasting models;hierarchical time series forecasting;hierarchical-decomposition residual network;linear layer;optimal predictions;prediction accuracy;proportion forecasting;residual forecasting;shallow neural network;two-stage models","","","","27","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Temporal Spatial Decomposition and Fusion Network for Time Series Forecasting*","L. Zhou; J. Gao","Zhejiang University, China; Anhui University, China","2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","2 Aug 2023","2023","","","1","10","Feature engineering is required to obtain better results for time series forecasting, and decomposition is a crucial one. One decomposition approach often cannot be used for numerous forecasting tasks since the standard time series decomposition lacks flexibility and robustness. Traditional feature selection relies heavily on preexisting domain knowledge, has no generic methodology, and requires a lot of labor. However, most time series prediction models based on deep learning typically suffer from interpretability issues, so the “black box” results lead to a lack of confidence. Dealing with the above matters forms the motivation of the thesis. In the paper, we propose TSDFNet as a neural network with a self-decomposition mechanism and an attentive feature fusion mechanism. It abandons feature engineering as a preprocessing convention and creatively integrates it as an internal module with the deep model. The self-decomposition mechanism empowers TSDFNet with extensible and adaptive de-composition capabilities for any time series and is more effective in predicting problems than traditional decomposition methods. Users can choose their own basis functions to decompose the sequence into temporal and generalized spatial dimensions. The attentive feature fusion mechanism has the ability to capture the importance of external variables and the causality with target variables. It can automatically suppress the unimportant features while enhancing the effective ones so that users do not have to struggle with feature selection. The basic idea of TDFNNet is straightforward. It integrates feature decomposition, feature selection, and prediction into one model. Moreover, TSDFNet can quickly look into the “black box” of the deep neural network by feature visualization and analyzing the prediction results. We demonstrate performance improvements over existing widely accepted models on more than a dozen datasets, and three experiments showcase the interpretability of TSDFNet.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191934","time series;interpretability;long-term prediction;deep learning","Deep learning;Visualization;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Robustness","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;feature selection;time series","adaptive decomposition capabilities;attentive feature fusion mechanism;black box results;decomposition approach;deep model;deep neural network;feature decomposition;feature engineering;feature visualization;forecasting tasks;fusion network;generalized spatial dimensions;self-decomposition mechanism;standard time series decomposition;temporal dimensions;temporal spatial decomposition;time series forecasting;time series prediction models;traditional decomposition methods;traditional feature selection;TSDFNet;unimportant features","","","","33","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the majority of data, the only way to predict the future is by discovering the hidden regularities of historical data. However, these regularities are difficult to learn. In the real world, time series patterns are complex, with a mixture of various trends and seasonality, and these sub-patterns are distinct. Thus, it is challenging for a single model to learn the regularities underlying these distinct sub-patterns. Second, these regularities are frequently obscured by noise, which makes it easy to overfit during the learning process. To address these problems, we propose a Bootstrap Decomposition Enhanced Orthogonal-Basis Projection model, or BDEOP: it first decomposes the data into several distinct sub-patterns with a bootstrap decomposition module; subsequently, it uses different modules to capture the hidden regularities and make the predictions based on these sub-patterns; simultaneously, the effect of noise is eliminated by randomly dropping the frequency components in the Fourier space.

NTiCD is a continuous optimization-based technique that leverages the power of deep neural networks to compute the score values. To this end, we use an LSTM to obtain the hidden non-linear representations of temporal variables in the time series data. Then, these features are aggregated using graph convolutional networks and decoded using an MLP that outputs the forecast of the future data values in the time series. The model is optimized based on a score function subject to regularized loss. The final output is a summary causal graph that captures the time-invariant causal relations within and between time series.

Then, the time features and data correlation extracted from different structures are fused through the Learnable Addition Mechanism. Finally, the traditional linear model is added to extract the mutation factors in the time series to correct the prediction results. In comparison to several of the most sophisticated baseline approaches, SATNet significantly outperformed them in our examination of real-world data with complex time series, with an average of 7 % higher.

However, existing studies suffer from limitations in their failure to account for the impact of periodicity on information granulation. As a result, the predictive outcomes of the model are significantly restricted, including issues such as the accumulation of original errors and low temporal correlation. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a novel approach for long-term time series forecasting by employing a multi-linear trend fuzzy information granule (FIG) within a periodic framework for LSTM. The proposed model tackles the problems through several key steps. Firstly, the time window is divided during the information gran-ulation process to enhance the periodic information of the time series. Secondly, a dynamic time warping (DTW) information granule segmentation and merging algorithm is utilized to adjust the division of information granules, ensuring periodic consisten-cy and alignment with the time series' change pattern.

This forecasting task faces several key challenges: First, the dynamics of COVID-19 exhibit complex spatial and temporal dependencies. The current growing trend at a location may be similar to that at another location in the past. Second, numerous factors, such as population mobility and geographic proximity between regions, mask usage, vaccine coverage, etc., significantly impact the dynamics. Third, we need to find the appropriate granularity for the forecasting task. The granularity should not be too coarse that we ignore the idiosyncrasies of individual regions. Still, the granularity should not be too fine that the prediction results are seriously vulnerable to noise.This paper addresses these challenges. We propose a simple but effective clustering algorithm that finds the appropriate granularity for the forecasting task. We invent generalized spatiotemporal attention, an attention mechanism that is generalized enough to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies and to flexibly account for intra- and inter-region characteristics such as geographic proximity and population mobility. Based on this generalized spatiotemporal attention, we designed COVID-Forecaster, a lightweight deep learning model for forecasting the dynamics of COVID-19. Experimental results demonstrate that COVID-Forecaster significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. For example, COVID-Forecaster reduces the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 6.8% and the weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) by 13.5% in forecasting the COVID-19 dynamics at the 3141 counties of the United States.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00221","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184813","COVID-19;multivariate time series;spatiotemporal forecasting;spatiotemporal attention;clustering","COVID-19;Pandemics;Sociology;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Forecasting","data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;epidemics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern clustering;regression analysis;time series","appropriate granularity;complex spatial dependencies;COVID-19 dynamics;COVID-19 enables government agencies;COVID-Forecaster;forecasting task;generalized spatiotemporal attention;geographic proximity;population mobility;public health administrators;simple but effective clustering algorithm;temporal dependencies","","","","28","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we propose an efficient Transformer-based model, named Conformer, which differentiates itself from existing methods for LTTF in three aspects: (i) an encoder-decoder architecture incorporating a linear complexity without sacrificing information utilization is proposed on top of sliding-window attention and Stationary and Instant Recurrent Network (SIRN); (ii) a module derived from the normalizing flow is devised to further improve the information utilization by inferring the outputs with the latent variables in SIRN directly; (iii) the inter-series correlation and temporal dynamics in time-series data are modeled explicitly to fuel the downstream self-attention mechanism.

To capture these intricate dependencies, spatio-temporal networks, such as recurrent neural networks with graph convolution networks, graph convolution networks with temporal convolution networks, and temporal attention networks with full graph attention networks, are applied. However, previous spatio-temporal networks are based on end-to-end training and thus fail to handle the distribution shift in the non-stationary traffic time series. On the other hand, the efficient and effective algorithm for modeling spatial correlations is still lacking in prior networks.In this paper, rather than proposing yet another end-to-end model, we aim to provide a novel disentangle-fusion framework STWave to mitigate the distribution shift issue. The framework first decouples the complex traffic data into stable trends and fluctuating events, followed by a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to model trends and events, respectively. Finally, reasonable future traffic can be predicted through the fusion of trends and events. Besides, we incorporate a novel query sampling strategy and graph wavelet-based graph positional encoding into the full graph attention network to efficiently and effectively model dynamic spatial correlations. Extensive experiments on six traffic datasets show the superiority of our approach, i.e., the higher forecasting accuracy with lower computational cost.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00046","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184591","traffic forecasting;spatio-temporal data;graph attention network","Training;Correlation;Convolution;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Weather forecasting;Market research","convolutional neural nets;graph theory;recurrent neural nets;spatiotemporal phenomena;telecommunication traffic;time series;wavelet transforms","complex traffic data;dual-channel spatio-temporal network;efficient algorithm;efficient spectral graph attention networks;end-to-end model;end-to-end training;graph attention network;graph convolution networks;model dynamic spatial correlations;nonstationary traffic time series;novel disentangle-fusion framework STWave;previous spatio-temporal networks;prior networks;public safety;reasonable future traffic;recurrent neural networks;resource optimization;spatio-temporal meet wavelets;temporal attention networks;temporal changes;temporal convolution networks;traffic datasets;traffic forecasting;wavelet-based graph positional encoding","","","","49","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud providers estimate storage usages based on the forecast and allocate resources accordingly. Overestimated space usages require a redundant storage buffer that brings unnecessary cost, and underestimated space usages will cause capacity shortages that may lead to data loss and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) failures. While accurate storage forecasting is important, it is highly challenging due to various storage usage patterns on different workloads and storage systems. Moreover, some operations from users or administrators may cause transient workload burst in historical data, which makes forecasting even harder.In this paper, we propose the Storage Usage Forecasting Service (SUFS) that combines deep neural networks and statistical models adaptively to make predictions for multiple major storage systems in ByteDance. SUFS carries comprehensive analyses of storage usage time series from various storage systems in real business scenarios. To handle workload bursts in historical data, we enhance regular LSTMs using a control signal that is installed on the input gate. When the burst is detected, the control signal reduces the input influences to the cell state. To further improve the prediction accuracy, SUFS integrates the Enhanced-LSTM (ELSTM) with a novel adaptive ensemble method. Different from previous works, our approach learns dynamic ensemble weights for each prediction step on-the-fly, making our model more accurate for multiple-step predictions. SUFS has been deployed to serve more than 150,000 storage instances. We conducted extensive experiments on the storage systems that are widely-used in ByteDance, and the results show that SUFS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and significantly reduces storage cost.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184683","storage usage forecasting;time series forecasting;model ensemble","Adaptation models;Costs;Scalability;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Logic gates;Stability analysis","cloud computing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;storage management;time series","000 storage instances;150 storage instances;accurate storage forecasting;allocate resources;generic Storage Usage Forecasting Service;overestimated space usages;redundant storage buffer;storage cost;Storage space usage forecasting;storage systems;storage usage patterns;storage usage time series;storage usages;SUFS","","","","42","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
