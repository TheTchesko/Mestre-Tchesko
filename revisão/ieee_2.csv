Finding patterns and trends in data requires a wide range of methods, including but not limited to cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. A data scientist's primary responsibility is to transform unstructured data into a form suitable for analysis through the processes of processing and cleaning. This approach utilizes several statistical procedures, such as calculating the mean, mode, median, standard deviation, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing. These techniques are useful for discovering abnormalities, missing values, and outliers in data, as well as for eliminating them. When the data has been cleansed and organized, it will be analyzed using statistical and machine-learning techniques to draw conclusions and make forecasts. To find patterns, trends, and correlations in the data, this study may make use of methods including clustering, classification, regression, and time series analysis. Data visualization is crucial to data science because it facilitates the dissemination of ideas and conclusions to stakeholders who may not have technical expertise. Scatter plots, bar charts, heat maps, and network diagrams are just a few of the data visualization methods that may be utilized to convey information interestingly. A wide variety of fields, from economics and finance to medicine and social media, can benefit from data science. Data science is useful in business for several purposes, including cost reduction, client retention, and discovery of untapped markets. As a field of study, data science has the potential to improve healthcare by aiding in areas such as disease detection, treatment, and the creation of new medications. Data science may be applied to social media to study user behavior and sentiment and to spot and stop criminality. It is a dynamic and promising new area that has the potential to revolutionize many different markets.

As a result of using blockchain technology, which decentralizes banking, daily cryptocurrency trading has become quite popular among observers, investors, customers, and many other groups. However, due to the daily fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies, prediction techniques enable stakeholders to look into the future and identify potential threats to their crucial investment operations. The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has made price predictions more promising for investors along with researchers. As artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced to such a level, forecasting the price of cryptocurrencies has grown in significance. In this study, we develop an approach based on machine learning and deep learning as a form of AI to forecast the price of various cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BinanceCoin (BNB), and FTX (FTT), based on their various pricing points. The results from the machine learning models demonstrated that linear regression performed better in forecasting all types of cryptocurrency, with a maximum R2 score of 0.9477, 0.9232, 0.9204, and 0.8925 for BTC, ETH, BNB, and FTT, respectively. However, our study found that the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a deep learning-based model, was the most effective algorithm for predicting the prices of all four types of cryptocurrencies. With GRU, we were able to predict the price of ETH with an R2 score as high as 0.9983, and we were also able to predict the prices of BTC, BNB, and FTT with R2 scores of 0.9969, 0.9772, and 0.9873, respectively.

It firstly applies VMD to decompose the time series according to frequency information, extracting nonlinear and non-stationary features in the sequence, and then LSTM exploited to capture the long-term dependencies of network traffic data.

A comprehensive analysis is conducted to find the optimal machine learning approach to classify the UAV operator in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and prediction time. The utilized dataset consists of recorded flying sessions of 20 different pilots based on four features, thrust, yaw, pitch, and roll. To balance the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized. A time-series forecasting approach is proposed to recognize repetitive patterns of pilot behavior over short time intervals.

This paper analyses the uncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting models using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact distribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on energy usage as a case study to evaluate the non-uniform effect of this intervention on the electricity demand distribution.

And two key steps to accurately realize STLF process are the utilization of relevant historical data from similar days and the revision of forecasting errors. However, the current STLF methods solely rely on weather similarity as a parameter for identifying similar days, leading to imprecise outcomes when predicting loads that are less susceptible to weather-related variables. Furthermore, the existing error revising methods are insufficient in feature extraction of high frequency fluctuation error series, which limits the further improvement of accuracy. To this end, this paper proposed a two-stage STLF approach. Firstly, the concept of comprehensive similar day is constructed. Based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) and load sequential characteristics, the comprehensive similar day of the time period to be forecasted (TPF) are selected by morphological similar distance (MSD). Secondly, the load data of comprehensive similarity days will be input into long short-term memory (LSTM) as extra information to get preliminary load forecasting results.

Building a reliable and useful demand forecasting model is still a challenging task. Machine learning techniques used for demand forecasting including Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Regressor are inadequate when dealing with time series. Recent works show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can learn non-linear relationships and time-series specific information from retail time series data. In this paper, a methodology based on Sequence to Sequence Long Short-Term Memory (Seq2Seq LSTM) network is proposed to tackle short-term retail demand forecasting problem. The Seq2Seq architecture commonly used for language translation is adapted to retail demand forecasting to improve LSTM's ability of learning long-range temporal dependencies from retail time series data. Experiments are evaluated with different input sequence lengths on store item sales dataset with daily resolution data. Bayesian Optimization is conducted to tune models' hyperparameters and examine whether it could enhance the prediction accuracy of the models.

It combines deterministic and stochastic representations with CNFs to create a probabilistic neural generative approach that can model the variability seen in high-dimensional structured spatio-temporal data. We specifically propose to use conditional priors to factorize the latent space for the time dependent modeling. We also exploit the use of masked convolutions as autoregressive conditionals in CNFs. As a result, our method is able to define arbitrarily expressive output probability distributions under temporal dynamics in multivariate prediction tasks.

Compared with conventional model-based model predictive control schemes, we utilize a series of input-output data to describe the system dynamics according to the behavioral systems theory. In order to improve system performance, multiple cost functions regulated by a suitable switching strategy are considered. For the nominal case with noise-free data, we prove that the proposed data-driven switched MPC schemes can ensure the exponential stability of the system provided that the switching signal satisfies the average dwell-time condition. Moreover, the robust stability is also analysed mathematically for the robust case considering bounded measurement noise. The effectiveness of the control algorithm is verified by the speed control of a commercial high bypass turbofan engine on a hardware-in-loop platform. The results of the experiment show the advantages of the proposed switched model predictive control scheme over conventional non-switched model predictive control schemes. Note to Practitioners—In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a control law to improve the performance of the system with multiple requirements that need a tradeoff. Since the performance criteria can easily be formulated in the cost function in model predictive control algorithm, it is a natural thought to design multiple cost functions which can be switched according to different performance requirements. However, the modelling process of the system is usually complicated and time-consuming for conventional model predictive control. In this paper, the data-driven method replaces the counterpart of the model in conventional model predictive control. The input-output measurements of the system can be directly used to forecast the dynamics of the system. The feasibility and stability of the control scheme are analyzed mathematically. We show that the proposed control law can ensure the above closed-loop performance of the controlled system, provided that the parameters of the controller are suitable and the switch of the cost function is sufficiently slow. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by the application of a high bypass ratio turbofan engine on a hardware-in-loop experiment platform.

The use of these resources at the current rate is not sustainable and will eventually lead to an energy crisis. Renewable energy resources such as wind, hydro, solar, geothermal, and biomass provide an optimal solution to this challenge owing to their replenishable and environmentally friendly properties. Although all renewable energy sources are advantageous, wind energy is the most promising among them. It is cost-effective, has a lower environmental impact, and has a higher energy density. However, wind speed is volatile, and accurate predictions are required to ensure the efficient functioning of the grid. With accurate prediction models, changes in wind speed can be anticipated, and energy production can be adjusted accordingly. In this context, a hybrid model has been proposed in this study, which combines the strengths of three different methodologies, namely SARIMAX, RNN, and SVR, to enhance forecast accuracy and overcome the limitations of individual models. The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) captures the linear relationship between wind speed and relevant meteorological data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) capture long-term dependencies in wind speed data. Support vector regression (SVR) is used to enhance the predictions of the combined model further. By leveraging wind speed data from a small wind turbine in Karachi, Pakistan, the proposed hybrid model's performance is compared to that of the individual models of SARIMAX, RNN, and SVR. The experimental results presented in this study demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the individual models regarding forecast accuracy.

However, power loads are influenced by many factors and have complex nonlinear, and time-varying characteristics. It is challenging to capture dynamic changes using traditional forecasting methods accurately. Based on the above, this paper studies a power load forecasting model based on an adaptive feedback loop network (AFLN). First, we use the grey correlation analysis to select similar days as the training data set and construct the meteorological feature vector as the input variable. Second, the adaptive feedback loop network is used to learn and fit the training data set. The network can adaptively adjust the feedback weight and time stepping to improve the modeling ability of time series data. Finally, experiments are conducted on the actual load data and compared with the traditional feedback loop network (FLN) and long-short-term memory network (LSTM). The results show that the proposed AFLN method has high prediction accuracy and stability and has research significance in short-term power load forecasting.","","979-8-3503-9841-0","10.1109/ICETCI57876.2023.10176620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10176620","Adaptive feedback loop network;Power load forecasting;Grey correlation analysis;Similar days;Meteorological feature vector","Adaptation models;Feedback loop;Adaptive systems;Load forecasting;Time series analysis;Training data;Predictive models","feedback;grey systems;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;time series","actual load data;adaptive feedback loop network;feedback weight;long-short-term memory network;planning;power industry;power load forecasting model;power loads;power system operation;short-term power load forecasting;time series data;traditional forecasting methods;training data set","","","","8","IEEE","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And methods of effectively predicting the short-term passenger flow of each subway station have aroused great concern. Traditionally, the LSTM deep learning model will be commonly used to process time series data. The reason is that it not only tackles the issue of long-distance reliance that RNN cannot deal with but also solves the trouble such as gradient explosion or gradient disappearance that are common in neural networks. However, in comparison to the LSTM model, the CNN-LSTM model makes it easier to extract the characteristics of time and space. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate which model has a better capacity for predicting passenger flow in metro stations. Undoubtedly, it can find that the CNN-LSTM model can accurately predict the daily traveler stream due to the excellent space extraction ability, through the evaluating function of MAE, MSE, and MASE. Additionally, the development forecast of passenger flow of urban transportation system is a basic work for the construction of urban transportation facilities.

The problem is formulated in terms of a multivariate time series analysis. Such a formalization allows to discover and model the temporal relationships among various descriptors and to forecast their behaviors for future periods. Techniques such as Vector Autoregressive models and machine learning (deep-based and tree-based) approaches are employed and compared in terms of performance and time complexity, by reframing the multivariate time series problem into a supervised learning one. Moreover, a series of auxiliary analyses (stationarity, orthogonal impulse responses, etc.) are performed to discover the analytical structure of the time series and to provide deep insights about their relationships.

Though being greatly successful of Transformer in computer vision and natural language processing, the potential of employing it as the general backbone in analyzing the ubiquitous times series data has not been fully released yet. Prior Transformer variants on time series highly rely on task-dependent designs and pre-assumed “pattern biases”, revealing its insufficiency in representing nuanced seasonal, cyclic, and outlier patterns which are highly prevalent in time series. As a consequence, they can not generalize well to different time series analysis tasks. To tackle the challenges, we propose DifFormer, an effective and efficient Transformer architecture that can serve as a workhorse for a variety of time-series analysis tasks. DifFormer incorporates a novel multi-resolutional differencing mechanism, which is able to progressively and adaptively make nuanced yet meaningful changes prominent, meanwhile, the periodic or cyclic patterns can be dynamically captured with flexible lagging and dynamic ranging operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate DifFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on three essential time-series analysis tasks, including classification, regression, and forecasting. In addition to its superior performances, DifFormer also excels in efficiency – a linear time/memory complexity with empirically lower time consumption.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3293516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177239","Deep forecasting;deep time series analysis;transformer","Time series analysis;Task analysis;Transformers;Forecasting;Predictive models;Market research;Analytical models","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the high randomness and variability of offshore wind power, it is difficulty to acquire good results by traditional trend extrapolation of time series of historical power data. In this regard, a novel N-BEATSX model improved by Copula entropy is proposed as a short-term prediction method for offshore wind power. First, the Copula entropy metrics are used to filter predictors to obtaining factors highly relevant to the active power output of offshore wind. Secondly, the auxiliary and historical power data from the wind farms are imported into the N-BEATSX model for future wind power forecasting. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed method. Comparing the prediction results of the proposed model with those of other models, it is demonstrated that the proposed method improves the accuracy of short-term prediction of offshore wind power.","","979-8-3503-4667-1","10.1109/CIEEC58067.2023.10167289","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52007112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167289","offshore wind power;wind power prediction;Copula entropy;N-BEATSX;correlation","Measurement;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Wind power generation;Wind farms;Market research;Entropy","entropy;extrapolation;load forecasting;offshore installations;power engineering computing;time series;wind power;wind power plants","auxiliary power data;future wind power forecasting;historical power data;N-BEATSX model;offshore wind power;short-term prediction method","","","","10","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, this paper innovatively adopts the convergence cross mapping algorithm (CCM) to identify the causal relationship of the change of electricity demand in various sectors, adaptively screens the prospective indicators that affect the sectoral electricity demand, and proposes a monthly sectoral electricity forecast method with embedded causality based on the temporal convolutional attention network (TCAN) model.

The industrial sector being a major influence on the total electrical power consumption. Despite its importance, industrial load forecasting (LF) is not a widely discussed topic in literature, despite the fact that it is influenced by a number of factors, such as planned operations and work shifts, that are unusual or unnecessary in conventional load forecasting models. Unlike time-series analysis, machine learning (ML) techniques are well-suited to the nature of the loads since they can simulate complex nonlinear relationships through a process that uses previous data patterns. In this paper, four data-driven machine learning strategies including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gaussian Process (GP), are compared to forecast an industrial load. These strategies can help in selecting the optimal model for load prediction. The results show that GP outperformed other ML techniques, thus yielding more accurate and reliable readings with lower estimation errors for electrical LF, but at the expense of higher computational time.","","979-8-3503-4667-1","10.1109/CIEEC58067.2023.10165934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10165934","Short term load forecasting (STLF);ANN;SVM;Decision tree;Gaussian process;Machine Learning","Support vector machines;Load forecasting;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Predictive models","decision trees;energy consumption;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;neural nets;power consumption;power engineering computing;support vector machines;time series","comparative analysis;conventional load forecasting models;data-driven machine;industrial load forecasting;industrial sector;load prediction;machine learning techniques;Machine learning-based short-term load forecasting techniques;ML techniques;planned operations;projected future energy consumption;Support Vector Machine;time-series analysis;total electrical power consumption;widely discussed topic","","","","27","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a load forecast method based on the long short-term memory model is established. This is characterized by using the observed load data of the same historical time section to improve the forecast accuracy.

The main work of step1 is data preprocessing and determining d (differential order) in ARIMA model. Further, a series of potential p (auto-regressive order) auto-regressive parameters values and q (moving average order) parameters values can be determined by examining the ACF (Auto Correlation Function) diagram and PACF (Partial Auto correlation Function) diagram. Then, the minimum BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) rule is used to determine a p parameter value and a p parameter value. In the third step, the next day call frequency is predicted and all parameters are updated in a automatically recursive manner. We apply this approach on 10 call frequency time series and analyze forecasting error. The average MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is 4.792%, which is much lower than other methods based on ARIMA model.

Firstly, considering the historical real output and prediction error, the historical data is decomposed based on the complete noise-assisted ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm (CEEMDAN). Then, the components are introduced into the long short-term memory (LSTM) optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO), and the components are reconstructed to obtain the original prediction curve and the error prediction curve. Finally, the empirical distribution function is used to revise the prediction error curve, and the original prediction curve and the error prediction curve are superimposed to obtain the final day-ahead report curve.

For example, self-driving cars need an accurate forecast of other agents' future actions to plan safe trajectories. Current methods rely heavily on historical time series to accurately predict the future. However, relying entirely on the observed history is problematic since it could be corrupted by noise, have outliers, or not completely represent all possible outcomes. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework for generating robust forecasts for robotic control. In order to model real-world factors affecting future forecasts, we introduce the notion of an adversary, which perturbs observed historical time series to increase a robot's ultimate control cost. Specifically, we model this interaction as a zero-sum two-player game between a robot's forecaster and this hypothetical adversary. We show that our proposed game may be solved to a local Nash equilibrium using gradient-based optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that a forecaster trained with our method performs 30.14% better on out-of-distribution real-world lane change data than baselines.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160721","","Training;Time series analysis;Games;Predictive models;Robot sensing systems;Nash equilibrium;Transformers","game theory;gradient methods;optimisation;time series","accurate forecast;agents;forecaster;future forecasts;game-theoretic approach;gradient-based optimization techniques;historical time series;modern robots;observed history;optimal decisions;out-of-distribution real-world lane change data;real-world factors;robot;robotic control;robust forecasting;robust forecasts;safe trajectories;self-driving cars;zero-sum two-player game","","","","41","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, more number of Base Station (BS) are required to cater to this ever increasing demand. But, a close observation leads us to a very interesting fact that load demand on base stations is not constant throughout the day, i.e., there are time periods in the day where usually load demand is at its peak and as day comes to an end, it is seen load demand decreases. But the base stations are continuously in the ON mode which leads to massive energy wastage and telecommunication companies have to pay a heavy financial cost. This forms the basis for our motivation to reduce energy consumption or in other words ‘Energy Saving’ in Radio Access Networks(RAN). Recent studies have confirmed the possibility of RAN energy savings by the dynamic on/off of various BSs. In order to determine the correct time for applying the sleeping mechanisms, we have to predict the off-peak traffic hours. In this work, we propose a novel open-source dataset which contains the load demand versus time data for base stations for 6000 hours to facilitate training of various deep learning models. We propose an efficient transformer based model named Deliberated Informer and evaluate its performance on our dataset which gives state of the art performance in the task of Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF).","","979-8-3503-2160-9","10.1109/ICMOCE57812.2023.10167012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167012","","Training;Base stations;Optical switches;Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Transformers;Task analysis","cellular radio;deep learning (artificial intelligence);energy conservation;energy consumption;load forecasting;mobile computing;radio access networks;smart phones;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;time series","Base Station;cellular traffic demand;deep learning models;Deliberated Informer;efficient transformer based model;energy conservation;energy consumption reduction;load demand prediction;load demand versus time data;long sequence time-series forecasting;LSTF;massive energy wastage;mobile smart phones;off-peak traffic hours;ON mode;open-source dataset;Radio Access Networks;RAN energy savings;sleeping mechanisms;telecommunication companies;time 6000.0 hour","","","","12","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, relying solely on radar echo maps as a single data source also limits the accuracy of short-term precipitation prediction. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal spatiotemporal feature fusion framework called MMSTP, which utilizes multi-modal data information from satellite images and radar echo maps. The encoder module of MMSTP is designed to combine the advantages of CNN and Transformer in local feature extraction and global information perception, respectively, and uses self-attention mechanism to model temporal features and perform multi-modal fusion. MMSTP is an end-to-end multi-modal, multi-scale, and multi-frame feature fusion framework that can significantly improve the accuracy of short-term precipitation prediction. It provides a new approach to spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problems.

Prior works on LMP calculation and forecasting shows that LMP is composed of generation cost, marginal loss cost and distribution network (DN) congestion cost. The focus of this work is to estimate the congestion component of LMP for radial DNs with only local parameter measurements. The true congestion component of LMP is derived by solving an OPF without penalizing the DN loss or generation cost. The estimated component of the LMP, referred to as the flexibility activation signal (FAS), is derived as a function of the nodal voltage profile at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the line loading of incoming and outgoing branches from PCC. The estimated and true congestion components of LMP for all nodes are analyzed via time series analysis using Granger causality and sensitivity and specificity of estimation output. Numerical case studies provide statistical evidence that voltage times series can be utilized to estimate congestion component of DN OPF. Further, we also show that with local parameter measurements such as line loading and/or voltage measurements can accurately estimate DN congestion incidents with an accuracy exceeding 95%. Although, localized congestion estimation is not entirely accurate, however, such a method is privacy-preserving, desired for autonomous operation without the need for centralized communication. Thus, proposed decentralized FAS estimation is inherently cyber-secure and resilient to external attacks, while mitigating DN congestion.","2165-4093","979-8-3503-1258-4","10.1109/EEM58374.2023.10161838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161838","Locational marginal price (LMP);statistical analysis;distribution network (DN);flexibility activation signal (FAS)","Voltage measurement;Costs;Thermal variables control;Time series analysis;Loading;Estimation;Thermal variables measurement","distribution networks;load flow;power engineering computing;power markets;pricing;time series;voltage measurement","congestion component;DN congestion incidents;estimated component;estimated congestion components;estimation output;FAS estimation;forecasting shows;generation cost;LMP;local measurements;local parameter measurements;localized congestion estimation;marginal loss cost;optimal power flow problem;true congestion components","","","","20","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic in large networks is typically governed by a complex interplay of auto-and cross-correlation patterns that largely determine its non-stationary nature.

Recently, machine learning techniques have gained wide-spread adoption for both long- and short-term power load forecasting. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is customized for time series data analysis. This research proposes an LSTM model for forecasting the power load of a single house containing electrical appliances over the next 20 days. We conducted a comparative analysis of the impact of dropout layers in load forecasting applications using the LSTM model. The proposed model comprises dropout rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. Their impact on load forecasting is examined. The experimental results demonstrate slight variations in predictions when altering dropout layers. The results show that the effect of dropout layers on the forecast varies the accuracy by only approximately 1%. However, the models with significant dropout rates are more general than those with lower or higher rates. So the model with a dropout rate of 0.4 is suggested.","","979-8-3503-3752-5","10.1109/HORA58378.2023.10156722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10156722","LSTM;Load forecast;Neural Network;Drop-out Layer","Load forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Market research;Planning;Power systems;Long short term memory","data analysis;domestic appliances;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;time series","drop-out layers;dropout layers;ensuring precise power load forecasting;household load forecast application;load forecasting applications;Long Short-Term Memory;LSTM model;power system;secure cost-effective functioning;short-term power load forecasting;steady, cost-effective functioning;time 20.0 d","","","","17","IEEE","26 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent works of urban human mobility prediction have made progress on the maximum predictability that any algorithm can achieve. However, existing approaches on maximum predictability on the multivariate time series fully ignore the interrelationship between multiple variables. In this paper, we propose a methodology to measure the upper limit of predictability for multivariate time series with multivariate constraint relations. The key of the proposed methodology is a novel entropy, named Multivariate Constraint Sample Entropy (McSE), to incorporate the multivariate constraint relations for better predictability. We conduct a systematic evaluation over eight datasets and compare existing methods with our proposed predictability and find that we get a higher predictability.

We observe urban traffic flow prediction has a hierarchical structure, in which human mobility prediction should consider not only the spatial and the temporal relationships, but also the high-level mobility trend between individuals and regions. In this paper, we propose a human mobility clustering algorithm based on trend iteration of spectral clustering (TISC) to incorporate the high-level human mobility trend between individuals and regions. We integrate our TISC clustering algorithm with two existing urban traffic flow predictive models: namely, deep spatio-temporal residual network (ST-ResNet) and deep spatio-temporal 3D network (ST-3DNet). By adapting our TISC clustering algorithm, the prediction accuracy of both algorithms has been improved significantly (30.96$\%$ for ST-ResNet and 24.66$\%$ for ST-3DNet). We also compare the TISC-based predictive framework with 26 state-of-the-art human mobility prediction algorithms. We observe that our TISC algorithm considerably outperforms all 26 methods, reducing the predictive error from $6.93\%$ to 69.55$\%$.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3288132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158906","human mobility prediction;spectral clustering;deep learning;smart city","Prediction algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Market research;Predictive models;Deep learning;Time series analysis;Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In 2022, the cost of pumping diesel and gasoline—the two fuels most commonly used to power automotive engines—rose to all-time highs, particularly for importers like Morocco, which is dependent on Russian energy supply. As a result, Morocco's inflation rate increased to 8.25% as people worried about whether or not oil prices would continue to soar. In order to provide an answer, this paper uses autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to forecast diesel and gasoline prices for the next eight years based on average yearly price values from 1991 to 2022. A MATLAB script is developed to compare the available models; the one with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) will be the best for making predictions. Based on the results, the ARIMA models with parameters (3, 1, 2) and (4, 1, 0) are suggested for predicting annual diesel and gasoline prices. Diesel prices look like they'll be staying within a narrow range of $1.1 and $1.45 until 2030. However, gasoline prices are expected to increase and reach a peak of $1.56 per liter in 2030.","","979-8-3503-9836-6","10.1109/IRASET57153.2023.10152952","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152952","ARIMA model;forecasting;oil prices;diesel;gasoline;applied statistics","Costs;Oils;Time series analysis;Internal combustion engines;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Forecasting","automotive engineering;autoregressive moving average processes;autoregressive processes;petroleum;power engineering computing;pricing;regression analysis;time series","annual diesel;ARIMA models;ARIMAModel;autoregressive integrated moving average;average yearly price values;diesel prices;forecast diesel;gasoline prices;global oil prices;lowest mean absolute percentage error;Morocco's inflation rate;power automotive engines-rose;pumped fuel prices;russia;Russian energy supply","","","","20","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to speed up decision-making on the most likely course of action, machine learning have shown their effectiveness in analyzing perioperative effects. In several technological sectors, ML models have been utilized for a while to specify and rank dangerous threat variables. To handle forecasting problems, several different prediction approaches are regularly used. The work shows how ML models can forecast the frequency of COVID-19 instances in the future, which is now considered to be a serious threat to civilisation. In this study, we carried out a comparison analysis of two widely used machine learning models: SVM and linear regression. Each model projects three variables: the cumulative count of confirmed cases, the cumulative count of fatalities, and the cumulative count of recoveries over the next 30 days. The study's conclusions demonstrate that applying these tactics to the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario is a viable choice. To boost accuracy, we used two ML models. The results of the experiment indicate that when it comes to COVID-19 prediction, Linear Regression yields the best results, while SVM yields the worst.","","979-8-3503-9836-6","10.1109/IRASET57153.2023.10152923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152923","Covid-19;Linear Regression;SVM;Machine Learning;time series","COVID-19;Support vector machines;Pandemics;Linear regression;Decision making;Sociology;Machine learning","epidemics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;regression analysis;support vector machines","COVID-19 pandemic;cumulative count;dangerous threat variables;decision-making;epidemiological scenario;forecasting problems;linear regression;machine learning;ML models;Morocco;SVM;technological sectors","","","","15","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crowd flow forecasting is challenging because it requires considering both the task of capturing the temporal dependency of data and capturing the spatial dependence. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a mechanism for referencing time-series features that are important for forecasting and incorporating graph convolution into Transformer, and we introduce CrowdFlowTransformer(CF-Transformer), a deep learning model based on Google's Transformer framework captures the Spatio-temporal dependency of time series. CF-Transformer captures the time series dependency by extracting important local time series from the past time series, inputting them to the decoder of Transformer, and encoding critical features into the model's input. We adapted CF-Transformer to a real-world crowd flow dataset. We evaluated it by comparing its forecasting accuracy with conventional models, and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms the conventional models.","2766-8576","978-1-6654-5381-3","10.1109/PerComWorkshops56833.2023.10150301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10150301","crowd flow;Transformer;graph convolution;time series forecasting;human mobility","Adaptation models;Convolution;Conferences;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Transformers","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);disasters;diseases;epidemics;feature extraction;graph theory;resource allocation;time series","capturing Spatio-temporal dependence;CF-Transformer captures;congestion prediction;COVID-19;crowd flow forecasting;CrowdFlowTransformer;deep learning model;disaster mitigation;forecasting accuracy;forecasting human mobility;Google's Transformer framework;guidance design;human resource allocation;important local time series;incorporating graph convolution;real-world crowd flow dataset;spatial dependence;Spatio-temporal dependency;time series dependency;time-series features","","","","18","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rather than having only local, segregated automation mechanisms (e.g., node self-configuration, SON), it is now agreed that end-to-end proactive automation is a must. In this paper, we present a novel solution for supporting automated and proactive decision-making at the network slice level in 5G/ Beyond 5G telecommunication systems. We propose a Graph-based Interpretable Anomaly Detection (G5IAD) framework that combines the use of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with model correlations between multivariate network slice Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and forecasts individual time series using Recurrent Neural Networks/GRUs. The architecture also includes an anomaly detection mechanism based on probabilistic classification. This unsupervised approach helps network operators identify & explain features of the KPIs, leading to faster root cause analysis and enabling self-managed network slices.

In particular, the introduction of Autoformer has further improved the performance of the model in long-term sequence prediction. However, Transformer-based models, such as Autoformer, have not fully considered the local temporal features of the sequence, and have not addressed the impact of sequence anomalies on decomposition and the processing of trend terms. To address these issues, we combined the excellent performance of the time convolutional neural network (TCN) on time series data and the advantages of the STL inner-outer loop decomposition to design the TEDformer, a Transformer prediction model enhanced with global and local temporal features. The model decomposes the time series into trend and periodic terms using STL and extracts temporal features accordingly. We conducted experiments on six real-world datasets, and the results showed that our model improved by 10.8% on multivariate datasets and 15.7% on univariate datasets compared to state-of-the-art models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10156810","Time series forecasting;Autoformer;Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks;Transformer","Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Transformers;Market research;Decoding;Data models;Forecasting;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
