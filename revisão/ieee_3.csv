Fraud detection allows for maximizing the effective economic return for such enterprises. This paper provides an electricity fraud detection approach based on robust exponential and Holt-Winters Smoothing methods. The proposed approach is a procedure that aims to discover the fraudulent behavior of electricity consumers and goes through three crucial steps: (1) the prediction of monthly consumption, (2) the detection of abnormal consumption of electrical meters, and (3) the detection of fraud cases of economic customers. The proposed model was trained and evaluated. Its experimental validation is achieved by using a large dataset of real users from the Algerian economic sector with almost 2000 clients and 14 years of monthly electricity consumption. The proposed solution revealed good performance compared to the literature and the comparison with the models implemented in this article: SARIMA for prediction and two sigma for anomaly detection. The results show highly efficient and realistic countermeasures to fraud detection, which leads us to say that this method is robust and can enhance company profit.","","979-8-3503-2102-9","10.1109/IC_ASET58101.2023.10150645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10150645","Fraud Detection;Electricity consumption;Holt-Winters Smoothing method","Economics;Meters;Measurement;Smoothing methods;Time series analysis;Companies;Predictive models","electricity supply industry;forecasting theory;fraud;power consumption;power meters;smoothing methods;time series","anomaly detection;electrical meters;electricity consumers;electricity distribution enterprises;electricity fraud detection approach;fraud cases;Holt-Winters;monthly electricity consumption;robust exponential;time 14.0 year","","","","17","IEEE","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SPMF aims to match power generation data under similar weather conditions to the current weather from station historical data, and provides the data as a reference to the power forecasting model to address the problem of insufficient generalization caused by lacking of high-precision data. In contrast to most recent approaches that use NWP data and Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate the similarity of weather conditions, the proposed approach operates on similarity index consisting of SSIM evaluated by satellite cloud map cloud coverage images along with Pearson correlation coefficients evaluated by power generation data. Notable, a power prediction model is developed to selectively measure the reference value of similar period data by similarity index. Results show that the SPMF and the proposed prediction model both improve the accuracy of power prediction, and the utilize of both improvements can increase the accuracy of power forecasting in ultra-short term period by up to 5.91% compared to traditional forecasting model.","","979-8-3503-3179-0","10.1109/GlobConET56651.2023.10150102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10150102","Distributed PV;Ultra-short term power forecasting;Similar time period;Satellite cloud images","Correlation coefficient;Satellites;Clouds;Distributed databases;Predictive models;Data models;Indexes","clouds;load forecasting;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;regression analysis;time series;weather forecasting","current weather;distributed PVs;high-precision data;high-precision meteorological data;low prediction accuracy;NWP data;Pearson correlation coefficients;power forecasting model;power generation data;power prediction model;prediction framework;PV power forecasting method considering weather similarity;satellite cloud map cloud coverage images;similar period data;similar time period matching framework;similar weather conditions;similarity index;SPMF;station historical data;traditional forecasting model;ultra-short term period;weak generalization ability","","","","33","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, stock market index prediction is challenging due to its nonlinearity and inherently volatile character. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and their variants are de facto standards for sequence modeling. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and attention-based networks, such as dilated casual convolutions and Transformers, have also become popular in time series forecasting. In this paper, we report on the design of a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) architecture based on MLP-Mixer, an all-MLP architecture for time series forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of MLP-Mixer-based architecture for sequence modeling. Modern deep learning models are increasingly built to handle univariate time series data. They generally pay attention to analyzing temporal dependencies while ignoring the relationship among features. The proposed architecture is specifically created for multivariate time series forecasting to capture temporal feature interactions while simultaneously learning feature correlations. To accomplish this, the proposed Time-Feature Mixer contains two types of MLP layers: feature mixer and temporal mixer. The feature mixer is applied independently to each data point to capture the correlation among features. In contrast, the temporal mixer extracts temporal dependency (trend, seasonal, cyclical, or random characteristics) of each feature across the whole input sequence. Compared to prevalent neural networks in sequence modeling, TS-Mixer exhibits competitive performance regarding S&P500 Index prediction.","2473-3490","979-8-3503-2244-6","10.1109/ICDEW58674.2023.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148151","stock market prediction;time series forecasting;neural networks;multi-layer perceptron;MLP-Mixer","Recurrent neural networks;Correlation;Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Transformers;Indexes;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);economic indicators;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;recurrent neural nets;stock markets;time series","all-MLP architecture;attention-based networks;Convolutional Neural Networks;dilated casual convolutions;economy;essential US economic indicator;feature correlations;inherently volatile character;market performance;MLP layers;MLP-Mixer-based architecture;modern deep learning models;multivariate time series forecasting;prevalent neural networks;Recurrent Neural Networks;S&P500 Index prediction;sequence modeling;stock market index prediction;temporal dependency extraction;temporal feature interactions;temporal mixer;Time-Feature Mixer;Time-Series Mixer architecture;TS-Mixer exhibits competitive performance;univariate time series data","","1","","24","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, fully grasping hydropower generation forecasting technology is an important way to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power grid and reduce the problem of water abandonment. For the existing hydropower generation forecasting technology lacks the analysis of the impact of upstream and downstream neighboring hydropower. A generation forecasting method that considers the coupling effect of adjacent hydropower is proposed. The method considers the hydropower runoff topology relationship and uses the relevant generation data of adjacent hydropower as features to model the generation of the target hydropower. The hydropower generation power is affected by multidimensional meteorological factors such as precipitation, runoff and temperature, etc. The EEMD-LSTM prediction model is constructed by considering the characteristic relationship of hydropower power-meteorological factors and the time-series characteristics of hydropower power, and the model is trained by using the historical power data and meteorological data of neighboring power stations and the target power station.

However, most of these sequence models are trained on univariate datasets and cannot leverage the information available in a multivariate setting. Moreover, the prediction/decision made by these models is not interpretable; consequently, the end users are unaware of the different steps involved in reaching that prediction/decision and cannot determine if the model aligns with the business and ethical values. This work investigates the performance of different sequence learners trained in a multivariate setting for the sales forecasting task. Specifically, different sequence models, including vanilla LSTM, stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, and convolution neural networkbased-LSTM, have been trained on the Walmart dataset, and a comparative analysis of their performance using mean squared error (MSE) and weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) metric is reported. For training the learners in a multivariate setting, relevant features have been identified using exploratory data analytics. Furthermore, these sequence models are made interpretable using the Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) model to explain away the key variables involved in the prediction task. Empirical results obtained on the Walmart sales dataset established that the performance of the stacked LSTM model is superior to other learners. Additionally, the stacked model being the most generalizable, is complemented by the LIME module to explain away its predictions using the relevant features.","2768-5330","979-8-3503-9725-3","10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142614","Explainable Artificial Intelligence;Interpretability;Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations;Multivariate Time Series Forecasting;Long Short-Term Memory Network;Auto Regression","Training;Measurement;Ethics;Data analysis;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Speech recognition","convolutional neural nets;data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;sales management;time series","convolution neural networkbased-LSTM;different sequence learners;different sequence models;Interpretable sequence models;Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation model;model aligns;multivariate setting;real-world sequence prediction tasks;sales forecasting task;sequence modelling;stacked LSTM model;stacked model;time series forecasting;Walmart sales dataset","","","","47","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, many people are afflicted with severe illnesses brought on by tainted water. This study will look at a water quality monitoring system because it provides information on water quality. It is planned to identify forecasts for water quality using a machine learning system.

With the increasing proportion of wind power, the reduction of its prediction accuracy directly affects the plan's enforceability. The lack of historical data is the primary problem facing the medium and long-term electricity forecasting of wind farms. In view of this, the existing historical data are expanded by means of wind historical data and data rolling; the diversity and multi-scale characteristics of wind power influencing factors make it difficult for a single method to obtain satisfactory prediction accuracy. In view of this, a combined prediction method based on improved empirical mode decomposition for monthly distribution of annual electricity of wind farms is proposed. Aiming at the fluctuation characteristics and laws of each component after the decomposition of historical data, appropriate prediction methods are used to improve the prediction accuracy, and then the overall accurate prediction is achieved through data restoration. The example results show that the above measures can effectively improve the prediction accuracy.","","979-8-3503-4560-5","10.1109/ICoPESA56898.2023.10140537","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140537","ensemble empirical mode decomposition;monthly electricity;data scrolling;weight allocation","Empirical mode decomposition;Time series analysis;Wind power generation;Wind farms;Predictive models;Maintenance engineering;Numerical simulation","load forecasting;maintenance engineering;power generation planning;wind power;wind power plants","annual electricity;annual power generation plan;appropriate prediction methods;data restoration;data rolling;existing historical data;long-term electricity forecasting;maintenance plan;monthly distribution quantity;monthly wind power generation;satisfactory prediction accuracy;wind farm;wind historical data;wind power influencing factors;year-ahead prediction method","","","","20","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the development of rail transport has exceptionally positive and significant effects on the country's macroeconomy, and investment in this sector leads to the prosperity of other economic sectors, the return on investment may be delayed or unclear. Consequently, this uncertainty diminishes the investment appeal in this field. Thus, predicting the price and future value of railway company stocks on the stock market is vital due to the need for the foresight to take safe investment measures and achieve sustainable financing. To this end, this paper investigated the use of deep learning methods to forecast the closing price of MAPNA and Toucaril stocks on the Tehran Stock Exchange. Stock prices were predicted using deep neural networks, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and CNN-LSTM networks as a hybrid model. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the models, MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 were used as evaluation criteria. The results indicate that deep learning models can forecast stock prices with accuracy.

They have become extremely popular, especially with the advent of free-floating systems that offer users flexible parking in order to facilitate the rental process. However, the problem of imbalance and maldistribution is among the major challenges of these systems, causing dissatisfaction and loss of customers. Therefore, to ensure the balancing of the fleet and to make the best decision for its reorganization, we must consider strategic locations that are accessible to all. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model for spatio-temporal demand forecasting using a multi-output regression technique. The main goal of the paper is to help pick the ideal areas for fleet deployment and balance the system according to user needs.

The behavioral data of different open-source software are closely related to their development prospects. However, most of these behavioral data are typical high-dimensional time series data streams with noise and missing values. Hence, accurate prediction on such cluttered data requires the model to be highly scalable, which is not a property of traditional time series prediction models. To this end, we propose a temporal autoregressive matrix factorization (TAMF) framework that supports data-driven temporal learning and prediction. Specifically, we first construct a trend and period autoregressive model to extract trend and period features from OSS behavioral data, and then combine the regression model with a graph-based matrix factorization (MF) to complete the missing values by exploiting the correlations among the time series data. Finally, use the trained regression model to make predictions on the target data. This scheme ensures that TAMF can be applied to different types of high-dimensional time series data and thus has high versatility. We selected ten real developer behavior data from GitHub for case analysis. The experimental results show that TAMF has good scalability and prediction accuracy.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3271327","School of Data Science Engineering, East China Normal University (ECNU); X-LAB; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138229","Autoregressive matrix factorization (MF);high-dimensional;open-source software (OSS);time series forecasting","Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models;Behavioral sciences;Market research;Software development management;Mathematical models","","","","","","","IEEE","29 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For alleviating such pitfalls, this study intends to forecast the Bitcoin price by comparing its deviations pre and post Covid using suitable ML algorithms.

Further, hyperparameters are selected by GA based on the fitness function. Based on this, hyperparameter tuning is performed which assist to improvise the model performance. For determining if there exists any deviations in Bitcoin price (pre and post Covid), Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is considered.

The accuracy of most models hovers around 50%, highlighting the need for further increases in precision, data handling, forecasting, and ultimately prediction.In this paper we present the result of our work on high-frequency (every fifteen minutes) stock-price prediction using technical data with a number of exogenous variables. These variables are carefully chosen to reflect the conventional wisdom in a traditional stock analysis on historical trend, general stock market condition, and interest rate movement. Several simple machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to test the premise that with the appropriate variables, even a simple ML model could produce reasonable prediction of stock prices. Therefore, the originality of our approach is a rational selection of relevant and useful features and also on-the-fly model re-training taking advantage of the human time scale of inference (price prediction) and moderate size of the models. Moreover we do not mix any trading strategy with our stock-price prediction experiments, to ensure that conclusions are not context-dependent.Systems that integrate and test sentiment and technical analysis are considered the best candidates for an eventual generalized trading algorithm that can be applied to any stock, future, or traded commodity. However, much work remains to be done in applying natural language processing and the choice of text sources to find the most effective mixture of sentiment and technical analysis.

Then, ARIMA model is used to predict mean change of linear elasticity and GARCH (Generalized Autore-gressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is introduced to predict ARIMA model residual and improve heteroscedasticity of nonlinear part of time series, and then ARIMA-GARCH model is established. Finally, predicted value is obtained by the sum of each component prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed prediction model has a high prediction accuracy in the short-term prediction of coke pushing current peak. The scheme is applied to actual coking production to guide production of coke.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128081","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973286,61603356,61733016); 111 project(grant numbers:B17040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128081","VMD;ARIMA-GARCH;Coke pushing current;Time series;Short-term forecast","Resistance;Ovens;Time series analysis;Noise reduction;Production;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","autoregressive moving average processes;coke;production engineering computing;time series","ARIMA model residual;ARIMA-GARCH model;autoregressive integrated moving average;coke pushing current peak;coke pushing operation;coking production;generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model;improved ARIMA model;production personnel;production status;time series;variational mode decomposition;VMD","","","","16","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, seasonal production and fish production forecasts were performed using the decomposition time series analysis technique and the ARIMA forecasting algorithm, respectively. The results revealed that the top four abundant species in Manila Bay were large head hairtail Trichiurus sp., Devi’s anchovy Encrasicholina devisi, Squid, and Common ponyfish Leiognathus equula. The abundance of pelagic fish indicates trophic cascades and overfishing in Manila Bay. Meanwhile, the ARIMA forecast results indicate that there are no significant relationships between the production of different species over time.

However, PV generation can be difficult to predict and the measurements of PV generation from BTM residential systems are often invisible behind a measurement of the net load, making net load forecasting challenging. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework for net load forecasting in areas with limited observability and high BTM PV generation. First, the profiles of observable customers are used to disaggregate the net load measurements into the pure load and PV generation. Then, separate models are used to forecast the PV generation and pure load individually, and the results are combined for a net load forecast. This paper also proposes a compensator for correcting the error of the net load forecast, using historical forecast errors of the PV generation, pure load, and net load. The proposed framework is tested through two case studies for areas with high BTM PV penetration and less than 10% observable customers.

Results show that the proposed disaggregation-forecasting framework reduces the error of the net load forecast compared to both benchmark models.

Traffic forecasting plays a pivotal role in ITS. Because of the natural graph properties of traffic road networks, graph convolutional network (GCN) is currently the mainstream method for modeling the spatial correlation of road networks. However, most GCN-based models use graph adjacency matrices that are either pre-defined based on Euclidean distances or learned through node embedding matrices. This results in the inability to model time-varying spatial relationship owing to various unexpected external factors. Moreover, traditional graph structures may not be able to fully encode complex spatial relationship. In this study, we first propose three aspects to be considered to model the spatial correlation of road networks: geospatial, functional spatial, and time-varying spatial correlations. We capture geospatial and functional spatial correlations from a global perspective and time-varying spatial correlation from a local perspective through a Time-varying graph structure generator (TVGSG). The time-varying spatial correlation of local perspectives is constructed by a hypergraph capable of capturing complex higher-order correlation. Then, we propose a framework named Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Convolutional Network (ASTHGCN), which combines graph diffusion convolution (GDC) and gated temporal convolutional network (Gated TCN) into a module capable of modeling spatio-temporal features simultaneously. By stacking multiple modules mentioned above, ASTHGCN is able to extract rich spatio-temporal information for advance prediction. Experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY demonstrated that ASTHGCN achieved the best performance compared to the baseline methods for both short-term prediction (15 min ahead) and medium and long-term prediction (30 and 60 min ahead).","2640-7574","978-1-6654-5278-6","10.1109/SANER56733.2023.00119","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123444","traffic forecasting;time-varying spatial correlation;hypergraph;graph diffusion convolution","Adaptation models;Correlation;Roads;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Logic gates;Time measurement","","","","","","22","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve the problems of insufficient relation mining and poor long-term prediction accuracy in building spatial relations based on physical distance in graph convolution, the diffusion graph convolution recursive neural network (DCRNN) noise prediction system ($ \alpha$DTW-DCRNN) based on the $ \alpha$ coefficient dynamic time warping ($ \alpha$DTW) method is proposed. First, the 3$\sigma$ criterion is innovatively used to deal with sparse zero-value noise data, and the DTW method is proposed to mine the spatial relationship. Second, the $\alpha$DTW method is proposed to calculate the similarity distance of unaligned periodic sequences using the penalty coefficient. Moreover, spatial relationships are reconstructed using $\alpha$DTW and noise is predicted using DCRNN for long-term forecasting needs. Finally, the Kalman filter driven by traffic flow data is used to correct prediction noise to improve prediction stability. Experimental results show that the proposed system can save training time, reduce prediction errors, and make long-term prediction more accurate.

In this paper, linear regression method is proposed to forecast long-term natural gas consumption in Bangladesh. This method is very useful in time series data and forecasting on long term basis. The trend line of the regression can forecast the long-term based demand of the natural gas in the country. The results of this study indicate that natural gas consumption in the country is increasing over time. Gas consumption has increased rapidly in the last 5-10 years and it is forecasted that the consumption will be increased drastically for the next few years. Some statistical parameters such as MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are performed to evaluate the forecasting accuracy.

This study employs a comparative analysis between three approaches to examine the accuracy of prediction based on suitable value of time lag. These include a statistical method based on the auto correlation function, the widely used machine learning method of regression analysis, and the best prediction is chosen based on the ideal time-lag value.

Data-driven approaches have been adopted in many research fields, including time series forecasting, which allows the modeling of complex data patterns without assuming a particular model representation. However, the superiority of such algorithms over traditional time series model-based methods has yet to be resolved for short-term rain attenuation predictions. We provide a comprehensive evaluation through empirical analysis using real-world measurements by comparing the performances of six main state-of-the-art algorithms involving two dimensions: the available training dataset and forecast horizon. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of data-driven algorithms over model-based methods with an increasing gap as the forecast horizon grows, reaching over 20% gain in the RMSE. Nevertheless, adopting data-driven algorithms in rainfall prediction requires a sufficient amount of available data and typically requires a significant number of observed rainfall hours, highlighting the challenge when the dataset is limited or unavailable.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10095815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10095815","rain-induced attenuation;commercial microwave links;time series forecasting;model- vs. data-driven","Rain;Time series analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Predictive models;Microwave communication;Prediction algorithms;Attenuation","","","","","","44","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we solve the electric load forecasting problem under extreme events such as scorching heats. One challenge for accurate forecasting is the lack of training samples under extreme conditions. Also load usually changes dramatically in these extreme conditions, which calls for interpretable model to make better decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel forecasting framework, named Self-adaptive Decomposed Interpretable framework (SaDI), which ensembles long-term trend, short-term trend, and period modelings to capture temporal characteristics in different components. The external variable triggered loss is proposed for the imbalanced learning under extreme events. Furthermore, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is employed in the framework for desirable interpretability. The experiments on both Central China electric load and public energy meters from buildings show that the proposed SaDI framework achieves average 22.14% improvement compared with the current state-of- the-art algorithms in forecasting under extreme events in terms of daily mean of normalized RMSE.

Yet, existing augmentation methods are mainly designed for classification, where class labels can be preserved even if augmentation alters the temporal dynamics. We note that augmentation designed for forecasting requires diversity as well as coherence with the original temporal dynamics. As time-series data generated by real-life physical processes exhibit characteristics in both the time and frequency domains, we propose to combine Spectral and Time Augmentation (STAug) for generating more diverse and coherent samples. Specifically, in the frequency domain, we use the Empirical Mode Decomposition to decompose a time series and reassemble the subcomponents with random weights. This way, we generate diverse samples while being coherent with the original temporal relationships as they contain the same set of base components. In the time domain, we adapt a mix-up strategy that generates diverse as well as linearly in-between coherent samples. Experiments on five real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that STAug outperforms the base models without data augmentation as well as state-of-the-art augmentation methods.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10097273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097273","Time Series;Data Augmentation;Forecasting;Decomposition;Spectral Analysis","Adaptation models;Frequency-domain analysis;Time series analysis;Training data;Signal processing;Data models;Robustness","","","","","","29","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to make good use of the seasonal information to predict the future is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a neural network model called Multilayer Seasonal Perception Network (MSPNet) to predict seasonal time series. Firstly, we propose the idea of seasonal alignment, which converts univariate time series into multivariate time series, in order to capture seasonal features more effectively. Secondly, we extract the seasonal features and historical dependencies, using the Multi-layer Seasonal Perception Attention. Finally, we combine the obtained nonlinear features with linear features to conduct the final prediction. Experimental verification shows that the proposed MSPNet model is significantly superior to the baseline methods on multiple public datasets.

However, since these methods mainly focus on predicting time series with a fixed dimension, they are inapplicable to the large-scale and ever-changing datasets that are common in real-world applications. Additionally, existing methods only take a window of the near past as input, which prevents the models from learning persistent historical patterns. To tackle these problems, we propose CoRe, a novel transferable long-term forecasting method enhanced by Covariates-guided Representation. By encoding the input series into a dense vector, CoRe is able to extract instance-wise global features. Specifically, the representation is learned by modeling the correlation between the target series and constructed auxiliary covariates, which is implemented by our proposed cross-dependency network. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that CoRe achieves overall state-of-the-art results and can transfer to unseen data with stable performance.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096231","Time series forecasting;representation learning;temporal dependency;encoder-decoder","Correlation;Time series analysis;Signal processing;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Encoding;Acoustics","","","","","","19","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effectively capturing the spatiotemporal information in these signals is essential for the downstream tasks. Previous studies have used the smoothness of the temporal differences of such graph signals as an initial assumption. Nevertheless, this smoothness assumption could result in a degradation of performance in the corresponding application when the prior does not hold. In this work, we relax the requirement of this hypothesis by including a learning module. We propose a Time Graph Neural Network (TimeGNN) for the recovery of time-varying graph signals. Our algorithm uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a specialized loss composed of a mean squared error function and a Sobolev smoothness operator. TimeGNN shows competitive performance against previous methods in real datasets.","","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10096168","Graph neural networks;graph signal processing;time-varying graph signal;recovery of signals","Time series analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Transformers;Graph neural networks;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Forecasting","","","","","","30","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) currently makes use of Hybrid and Mathematical approaches to forecasting Indian summer monsoon rainfall. As a corollary, analysts are barely able to predict the socioeconomic repercussions of floodwaters (excessive rain) or famine (fewer drops of rain). The amount of rain that falls relies on various factors, including the temperature levels in the atmosphere, wetness, wind, velocity, and wind conditions. Several methodologies have been used in weather prediction. In this paper, two forecasting approaches are preferred: ARMA (Auto-Regressive Moving Average) and ARMAX (Auto-Regressive Moving Average with exogenous variables). The Ensemble strategy effectiveness is evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and MAE. It is observed that the ARMA+ARMAX model has the least values of MAE at 4.921, MSE at 4.654and RMSE at 2.456 when compared with cutting-edge strategies.","2575-7288","979-8-3503-9737-6","10.1109/ICACCS57279.2023.10113031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113031","Agriculture;Rainfall;Temperature;Climatic Changes;Time-Series Forecasting Model;Rainfall Prediction","Rain;Temperature;Wind speed;Time series analysis;Crops;Weather forecasting;Production","autoregressive moving average processes;mean square error methods;monsoons;rain;regression analysis;time series","ARMA+ARMAX model;ARMAX time-series forecasting models;Auto-Regressive Moving Average;excessive rain;exogenous variables;famine;fewer drops;forecasting approaches;forecasting Indian summer monsoon rainfall;IMD;Indian Meteorological Department;Mathematical approaches;rainfall prediction;socioeconomic repercussions;temperature levels;weather prediction;wind conditions","","","","21","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
