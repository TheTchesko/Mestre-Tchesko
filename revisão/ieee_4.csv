This study aims to predict the Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using advanced machine learning algorithms. To achieve this, we collected data from various sources, including time series analysis and inflation rate. We analyzed the data using linear regression and polynomial regression techniques to determine which method produced the most accurate results. Our results showed that the polynomial regression model outperformed the linear regression model in terms of accuracy. The polynomial regression model was better able to capture the non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable (GDP). Specifically, our findings showed that the polynomial regression model was able to predict the Indian GDP with an accuracy of 91%, compared to 87% for the linear regression model. This study highlights the importance of using advanced machine learning algorithms in economic forecasting. We found that the use of high-quality data sets and advanced techniques such as polynomial regression can significantly improve the accuracy of economic forecasts. Our findings have several implications for policymakers and businesses. Accurate predictions of economic indicators such as GDP can help businesses make informed decisions about investment and growth strategies, while policymakers can use these predictions to develop effective economic policies. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting Indian GDP. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of polynomial regression in capturing non-linear relationships and improving the accuracy of economic forecasts.

This paper proposes week ahead wind power forecast based on a time-series forecasting model using ensemble learning such as Random Forest Regressor, XGBoostRegressor, CatBoostRegressor and other machine learning algorithms such as support vector regression, and linear regression and calculates the accuracy of all algorithms to make an accurate week ahead forecast. The dataset collected on a wind farm for a period of two years is taken and used for training and testing the time-series forecasting models. The dataset contains weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and pressure, and wind parameters like wind direction and speed at the wheel hub height. The best week-ahead forecasting algorithms are found to be Random Forest Regressor and CatBoostRegressor.

Recurrent neural networks and various deep learning algorithms have been applied around modelling and forecasting multivariate time series data. Due to the intricate nonlinear patterns and significant variations in the randomness of different categories of real-world time series data, it is a formidable task for a deep learning model to simultaneously achieve effectiveness and robustness. We proposed a model to counter the challenges and provide more precise results as compared to existing state-of-art models. Firstly, a feature selection is performed via two strategies concurrently. Subsequently, the data is converted into an image, and then Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract attributes from the images. Concurrently, the clustering is done on the data, and each cluster is fed to the residual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) so that the lower layers can transmit information directly to the upper layers through highways, increasing information flow freedom. Because of this, gradients can be passed more directly through the layers with the addition operators making training much easier. Then the output of CNN and Residual LSTM is combined and passed to the machine learning models. The model is benchmarked on a couple of datasets. For the capital bike sharing dataset, the proposed model improves the Root Mean Squared Error by ~15% and Mean Absolute Error by ~20%.","","978-93-80544-47-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10112448","Deep learning;Feature selection;Time series forecasting;CNN;Gramian Angular Field (GAF);LSTM;K-means clustering;Residual LSTM;Neural networks","Deep learning;Time series analysis;Transfer learning;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Data models;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","32","","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this challenge, we propose a slow shifting concerned machine learning method for traffic flow forecasting, which includes two parts. First, we take advantage of Empirical Mode Decomposition as the feature engineering to alleviate the nonstationarity of traffic flow data, yielding a series of stationary components. Second, due to the superiority of Long-Short-Term-Memory networks in capturing temporal features, an advanced traffic flow forecasting model is developed by taking the stationary components as inputs.

Precise forecasting can balance the demand and supply of electrical generation, and with the growing use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, more accurate forecasting is necessary. Our objective was to find a forecasting model that can best fit demand forecasting. Transformer is the name of the model that we applied in the forecasting task.

These metrics were previously observed using huge, pricey, and fixed air quality monitoring stations. Due to their high cost, these stations cannot be installed in many locations, which results in a dearth of monitoring stations in many locations. These problems can be solved with the use of compact, affordable, and portable air quality monitoring systems. Additionally, it is possible to automate and monitor air quality using inexpensive air quality monitoring equipment. These systems can be used in any home and office, car and etc. In this paper, we built and put into action a portable, affordable, and tiny hardware platform for monitoring air quality that can be accessed remotely through a web application.

The biggest challenge faced by various researchers is the choice of the forecasting technique which can be used for accurate forecasting of the future dataset. The most important requirement for use of a prediction model is that it should be able to introduce time series elements outside the scope of training data which is the lacking feature in most of the regression-based models. Time series models accounts for the major advantage in this context. Two time series models Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models are used in this work for the prediction of time dependent variables such as load profile and various temperatures of an operating power transformer located at 400kV Grid Substation, Jodhpur, India. Both the models are employed on four parameters which includes ambient temperature, load factor, oil temperature and winding temperature data, the inputs of which are taken for a month duration on hourly basis. The validation of both the forecasting models has been assessed by comparative study of the output being obtained in the results. The final results indicates that SARIMA model which takes into account seasonal factor proves to give a better prediction as compared to the ARIMA model. The major challenge faced in the use of time series models was the selection of the parameters of both the two proposed models which are p (order of AR term), D (order of differencing) and q (order of MA term) which includes formation of auto correlation and partial auto correlation plots which are time consuming with addition of human error. This problem is being resolved by the use of AUTO ARIMA which automatically generates the value of these parameters which are best fit for the model.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099709","Time series analysis;ARIMA;SARIMA;power transformer;load;temperature","Temperature distribution;Analytical models;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models;Power system reliability;Power transformers","autoregressive moving average processes;load forecasting;power transformers;regression analysis;time series","ambient temperature;ARIMA model;forecasting technique;load factor;oil temperature;power transformer;regression-based models;SARIMA model;seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models;time dependent variables;time series based predictive model;time series elements;voltage 400.0 kV;winding temperature data","","","","15","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both historical stock data and social media analysis can be used to make predictions. The stock market's volatile nature makes it difficult to make reliable predictions based on historical data, and it's possible that certain relevant sectors were overlooked owing to their lack of significance in certain stocks or a lack of data. A difficult task in financial time series prediction is forecasting the direction of stock price indices. Traders and shareholders alike could benefit from a more informed understanding of how to forecast stock price movements. The intricacy of stock market data makes it challenging to create accurate prediction models. As the future is essentially unknown, accurate market forecasting is difficult. In order to make accurate forecasts, the data must first be cleansed. Stock price forecasts for Adani Green Energy Limited were attempted in this paper. Seven characteristics were extracted from stock prices during the past five years. The research was carried out, and around 1088 cases were considered. Five years' worth of stock price history from Yahoo Finance is obtained and used that as the basis for our dataset. The primary goal was to make reliable price predictions, therefore we focused on those metrics. Linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost Regressor were used to train the dataset. Achievable accuracy rates of 95% or more were achieved by all models, with a best-case scenario of 98.65% being achieved by the XGBoost Regression model. We used XGBoost 1.0.1 and fine-tuned its settings to maximize performance, which included a maximum depth of 7, a number of estimators in the thousands, and more. In addition, cross-validation and Repeated KFold scores were generated. The XGBoost Regressor's Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was calculated as well. The incorporation of the ChatBot into our study was the most notable improvement. This was educated with the help of natural language processing, so it could converse with the user and provide satisfactory responses to their inquiries. Furthermore, the research work proposed a number of changes that could be made to these methods in order to increase their accuracy.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10100106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100106","Stock Market;Data Analysis;Machine Learning;Predictive Analysis;Linear Regression;XGBoost","Social networking (online);Time series analysis;Neural networks;Predictive models;Chatbots;Reliability;Stock markets","chatbots;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;pricing;random forests;regression analysis;share prices;social networking (online);stock markets;time series","accurate market forecasting;accurate prediction models;accurate stock market forecasts;computer scientists;financial time series prediction;historical data;historical stock data;reliable price predictions;shareholders;social media analysis;stock market data;stock market forecasting;stock price forecasts;stock price history;stock price indices;stock price movements;stock prices;traders;XGBoost Regression model;XGBoost Regressor's Mean Absolute Error","","","","16","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It facilitates the analysis and forecasting of complex time series expressing various hidden components such as the trend, seasonal components, cyclic components and irregular fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial in many fields for forecasting and decision-making processes. In recent years, many methods of time series decomposition have been developed, which extract and reveal different time series properties. Unfortunately, they neglect a very important property, i.e., time series variance. To deal with heteroscedasticity in time series, the method proposed in this work – a seasonal-trend-dispersion decomposition (STD) – extracts the trend, seasonal component and component related to the dispersion of the time series. We define STD decomposition in two ways: with and without an irregular component. We show how STD can be used for time series analysis and forecasting.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2023.3268125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105521","Time series analysis;time series decomposition;time series forecasting","Time series analysis;Market research;Additives;Forecasting;Time-frequency analysis;Matrix decomposition;Task analysis","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is a challenging task, as we need to consider both complex intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. Existing works only learn temporal patterns with the help of single inter-variable dependencies. However, there are multi-scale temporal patterns in many real-world MTS. Single inter-variable dependencies make the model prefer to learn one type of prominent and shared temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network (MAGNN) to address the above issue. MAGNN exploits a multi-scale pyramid network to preserve the underlying temporal dependencies at different time scales. Since the inter-variable dependencies may be different under distinct time scales, an adaptive graph learning module is designed to infer the scale-specific inter-variable dependencies without pre-defined priors. Given the multi-scale feature representations and scale-specific inter-variable dependencies, a multi-scale temporal graph neural network is introduced to jointly model intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. After that, we develop a scale-wise fusion module to effectively promote the collaboration across different time scales, and automatically capture the importance of contributed temporal patterns. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that MAGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across various settings.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2023.3268199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105527","Graph learning;graph neural network;multi-scale modeling;multivariate time series forecasting","Forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Adaptive systems;Adaptation models;Power demand","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It creates confidence and helps make someone likeable. People are following new trends and placing a greater demand for fashion goods as they become more concerned with their appearance. Many people are entering the fashion and textile industries as demand for fashion items rises. But this trip also involves changes in fashion. Based on how long a fashion trend lasts, there are many sorts of fashion lifecycles. The lifecycle of a given fashion is defined as “normal” by its average survival time. Therefore, fashions and trends become popular rapidly but cannot last for a long time. These fashion lifecycles are referred to as “fads.” “Classic” fashion is that which endures for a longer amount of time. It is easier to predict impending changes in fashion if a businessperson has analytical knowledge on hand. In this way, it will be advantageous for customers as well. Appropriate business decisions will be made in order to prevent excessive loss, and it will also give the right fashion advice to the client so that they invest their money in the right direction. Fashion picture analysis is helpful for a variety of fashion-related applications, including fashion retrieval and fashion recommendations. There are numerous websites that predict next fashion trends, like Heuritech, Wgsn, and Trendzoom, among others. The motive of this study is also the same, but we will make some more advanced changes in this regard.

Organizations tasked with preventing natural catastrophes might benefit from using meteorological time series data prediction in their decision-making processes. The volume, dimension, and frequency of updates to Time Series data are quite high. The study of period sequence data for forecasting is a crucial part of the practical application. Time series data analysis allows for more precise rainfall forecasts, which is useful for assessing the severity of potential droughts and floods. Precipitation forecasting publications have employed a wide range of approaches. This improved forecast accuracy may be attributed to these methods. In this research, we apply a deep learning technique to examine the precipitation records from the Karnataka Division. This article presents a network consisting of a generator and a predictor for predicting spatial-temporal rainfall data. To imprisonment spatial correlations and build high-resolution data from sparse comments, it uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in its generative module. A Multivariate Convolutional (MVC-LSTM) network is used to create the prediction unit; this network is able to capture the interplay between many variables and their temporal and spatial correlations. The Honey Badger approach finds the appropriate weight for the LSTM, which improves the model's ability to classify data.

It can be regional resources like climate, soil type, flora and fauna, precipitation, crop culture, etc. Also, many indicators are available that can define a drought and its type. Scientists have tried to find the most reliable indicator to identify the drought. They have concluded that no best indicator exists. In order to find the best fit, researchers recommend focusing on regional resources.

Expectations of inflation influence many financial and economic actions, and this dependence motivates economists to develop techniques for precise inflation forecasting. Nearly everyone in the economy is impacted by inflation, including lending institutions, stock brokers, and corporate financial officials. In many cases, inflation determines whether a firm will accept a particular project or if banks will make a particular loan. These different economic actors can modify their financial portfolios, strategic goals, and upcoming investments if they are able to forecast changes in inflation rates. The multiple interaction economic components that depend on inflation will be better understood by economic agents operating in a business context if inflation forecasting accuracy is improved. There are numerous techniques to forecast inflation ranging from basic statistical methods to complex neural network methods. Therefore, this paper employs LSTM model to train and analyze the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicators to obtain inflation-related prediction results.

Two modules comprise the forecasting model: the anomaly detection module and the forecasting module. Singular values are detected and corrected by the anomaly detection module. And in the forecasting module, the series is first divided into different intervals. After that, the divided data is passed through a decomposition module embedded in the neural network, and each interval is encoded as high-dimension vectors. These vectors are fed into the mixing layer, which is used to learn the relationship between intervals and channels after the encoding process. Every mixing layer comprises two different layers: the channel-mixing layer allows communication between different channels, and the interval-mixing layer allows communication between different intervals.

For problem 2, an Idle Time (IT), a parameter which is tracked from the time spent by the EV users (after fully charged) on the charging station, and this IT variable is estimated using logistic regression (LR) and linear support vector classifier (SVC). The preliminary results are encouraging, as RF yields better results in MAE over other methods with 7.26 on historical weekdays data, and SVC performs better in estimating Idle Time with an accuracy of 85% over LR 81%.","","979-8-3503-3286-5","10.1109/CCWC57344.2023.10099356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099356","Electric Vehicles;Charging station;Machine Learning;Vehicle- to-Grid","Vehicle-to-grid;Load forecasting;Static VAr compensators;Estimation;Support vector machine classification;Artificial neural networks;Charging stations","autoregressive moving average processes;battery powered vehicles;demand forecasting;electric vehicle charging;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;logistic regression;power engineering computing;probability;random forests;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series;vehicle-to-grid","54 charging stations;aggregated available capacity;charging infrastructure;Electric Vehicles market;EV users;funda-mental problems;historical data sets;historical weekdays data;linear support vector classifier;load forecasts;machine learning;Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average;term Electric Vehicle demand forecasts;time 20.0 min;time 30.0 min;university campus charging station;V2G;Vehicle-to-Grid connection;Vehicle-to-Grid Idle- Time Estimation","","","","45","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of anticipated values, electric power is purchased. To adequately meet plant demands, it is crucial to predict the consumption of electricity as precisely as possible. The more exact the forecast, the better the financial outcome. The dataset utilized in this research is a time series of power consumption values in Megawatts (MW) which ranges from 203.2208 MW to 216.4605 MW and 744 samples were collected in total from the observations of electric power consumption (hourly) by NPPs. The entire data needs to be preprocessed and some Gradient Boosting approaches including Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGBoosting), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were applied while maintaining the 70%-30% training-testing ratio of the dataset. XGBoost classifier demonstrates 99.81% ac-curacy for predicting power consumption (with 0.982 Coefficient of Determination, 0.0044643 Mean absolute percentage error, and 0.0668 root mean square error), which is better than other models (SGBoost and LightGBM).

First, a combined similar day screening model based on grey relational analysis and cosine similarity is constructed, which makes up for the shortcomings of the single selection method. The training set and test set ensure the quality of the input data of the model; then use the single-feature time series training to increase the dropout layer of the LSTM model for power load prediction, reduce the resource consumption of training and prediction, and effectively alleviate the occurrence of overfitting., to improve the robustness of the model. The prediction results of the two examples basically coincide with the real value in trend, which confirms that the similar daily screening and improved LSTM combined prediction model constructed in this paper can provide reliable support for power load forecasting and other time-series data forecasting applications.","","978-1-6654-6253-2","10.1109/EEBDA56825.2023.10090732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090732","short-term power load;forecasting;similar day selection;LSTM","Training;Industries;Load forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Data models","electricity supply industry;grey systems;load forecasting;power engineering computing;power generation control;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation planning;recurrent neural nets;time series","cosine similarity;day screening model;dropout layer;economic operation;electric power industry;grey relational analysis;industrial development;input data quality;LSTM model;power load prediction;power system dispatch;power system operation control;power system planning;resource consumption;short-term power load forecasting;single-feature time-series data forecasting applications;test set","","","","17","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distribution networks include a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such as individual consumers, low-voltage feeders, and transformer stations. It is impractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for each load separately. Additionally, such local models also (i) (largely) ignore the strong dependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial proximity and the characteristics of the distribution network, (ii) require historical data for each load to be able to make forecasts, and (iii) are incapable of adjusting to changes in the load behavior without retraining. To address these issues, we propose a global modeling framework for load forecasting in distribution networks that, unlike its local competitors, relies on a single global model to generate forecasts for a large number of loads. The global nature of the framework, significantly reduces the computational burden typically required when training multiple local forecasting models, efficiently exploits the cross-series information shared among different loads, and facilitates forecasts even when historical data for a load is missing or the behavior of a load evolves over time. To further improve on the performance of the proposed framework, an unsupervised localization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also proposed to localize/personalize the global forecasting model to different load characteristics. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms naive benchmarks by more than 25% (in terms of Mean Absolute Error) on real-world dataset while exhibiting highly desirable characteristics when compared to the local models that are predominantly used in the literature.

"Risk Assessment Using Information Entropy","P. Franklin",McKissack and McKissack,"2023 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","5 Apr 2023","2023","","","1","4","SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSRisk assessment, particularly when using simulations, requires that the analyst develops estimates of expected, low, and high values for inputs. Mean and standard deviation are often used to assess the variability of metrics, assuming that the underlying distribution is normal. However, it is increasingly realized that non-normal distributions are common and important. If data are available, it is simple and straightforward to check this assumption by computing higher order moments.Claude Shannon [1], [2] proposed that the information entropy for a set of N discrete events can be measured by\begin{equation*}H = - \Sigma {p_i}\ln {p_i}\tag{1}\end{equation*}E. T. Jaynes [3] proposed that, if data is available, information entropy can be maximized using Lagrangian multipliers and that the resulting probability distribution maximizes the uncertainty of that distribution given the data.In order to use entropy maximization, it is required to define constraints such that Σpi = 1, plus constraints on the mean, variance, skew, kurtosis, and other moments. This problem does not have a closed form solution but can be solved iteratively in a spreadsheet.The problem can be set up as follows for mean $\bar x$ and variance s2:\begin{equation*} \begin{array}{l} H = - \Sigma \left({{p_i}\ln {p_i}}\right) + {\lambda _0}\left({\Sigma {p_i} - 1}\right) + {\lambda _1}\Sigma \left({{p_i}{x_i} - \bar x}\right) + \\ {\lambda _2}\Sigma \left[ {{p_i}{{\left({{x_i} - \bar x}\right)}^2} - {s^2}} \right] \\ \end{array} \tag{2}\end{equation*}This basic formulation models the normal distribution. The importance of non-normality can be estimated by adding higher order moments as desired. For n ≥ 3, constraints can be added using:\begin{equation*}{\lambda _n}\Sigma \left[ {{p_i}{{\left({\frac{{{x_i} - \bar x}}{s}}\right)}^n} - {M_n}} \right],\end{equation*}where Mn is the computed nth moment of the data set.Differentiating ∂H/∂pi = 0 maximizes information entropy, and the resulting probability distribution has the most uncertainty given the observed data.This suggests that it is possible to develop an estimate of the distribution where some values are underrepresented in the sample. It further suggests that unusual or atypical results can be better estimated.This paper uses the method of maximizing entropy to model observed data and will study two time series applications. One problem of interest is sequential acquisition of data. For example, time to failure for a device may be a metric of concern. A maximum entropy model provides an empirical estimate of the distribution of this metric. A second problem of interest is forecasting the distribution of a metric at some point in the future. This applies to supply chain management. Project sponsors prepare cost and schedule estimates well in advance of placing the orders for the materials used in those projects. Management reserves for cost and schedule are typically set by subject matter experts, and recent experience (e.g., supply chain disruptions due to the COVID19 pandemic) may overemphasize current data when developing risk assessments. This approach offers a datadriven way to empirically develop risk assessments.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088238","Risk Assessment;Information Entropy;Maximum Entropy","Measurement;Schedules;Uncertainty;Costs;Time series analysis;Supply chains;Entropy","maximum entropy methods;normal distribution;optimisation;probability;project management;risk management;supply chain management;time series","Claude Shannon;closed form solution;cost;define constraint;entropy maximization;higher order moments;information entropy;Lagrangian multipliers;management reserves;maximum entropy model;mean deviation;N discrete events;normal distribution;probability distribution;risk assessment;sequential acquisition;standard deviation;supply chain management;time series","","","","5","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the number of sensors is usually limited, and sensor data are incomplete and scattering, which hinders the capability of capturing the corrosion growth behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes Multi-sensor Corrosion Growth Model with Latent Variables to predict the corrosion growth process in oil refinery piping. The proposed model is a combination of the hierarchical clustering algorithm and the vector autoregression (VAR) model. The clustering algorithm aims to find the hidden (i.e., latent) data clusters of the measured time series data, from which the time series from the same cluster will be included in the VAR model to predict the corrosion depth from multiple sensors. The model can capture the relationship between sensor time series data and identify latent variables. A real case study of an oil refinery system, in which in-line inspection (ILI) data were collected, was utilized to validate model. Regarding corrosion growth prediction, the paper compared the prediction accuracy of VAR model with other three forms of power law model, which is widely accepted to expect the time-dependent depth of corrosion such as power function (PF), PF with initiation time of corrosion (PFIT), and PF with initiation time of corrosion and covariates (PFCOV). The results showed that VAR model has the lowest prediction error based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation for test data. Finally, the proposed model is believed to be useful for dealing with a complex system that has a variety of corrosion growth behaviors, such as the oil refinery system, as well as it can be applied in other real-time applications.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088257","corrosion growth models;clustering;oil refinery;time-series forecasting;latent variables","Reactive power;Corrosion;Time series analysis;Clustering algorithms;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models","autoregressive processes;corrosion;gas industry;inspection;mechanical engineering computing;pattern clustering;petroleum industry;pipelines;sensor fusion;time series","corrosion growth behaviors;corrosion growth prediction;corrosion growth process;corrosion process;environmental conditions;hierarchical clustering algorithm;ILIdata;in-line inspection data;latent variables;MAPE evaluation;mean absolute percentage error evaluation;multiple sensors;multisensor corrosion growth modeling;oil refinery piping;oil refinery system;oil-gas pipelines;PFCOV;power function;power law model;sensor data;sensor time series data;VAR model;vector autoregression model","","","","25","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pipeline corrosion management which typically requires high-resolution inline inspections (ILI) to characterize the corrosion growth process is an important task to assess the corrosion defects. However, the corrosion process is inherently stochastic, temporal-spatial dependent, and driven by various hidden physics-related variables. In the literature, the growth of corrosion defects in pipelines is usually modeled by various stochastic processes imposing many unjustified assumptions about the mean growth path and probability distribution of the corrosion rate. In this paper, we proposed a physics-informed latent variable corrosion growth model that integrates the known physics from complex processes into modeling the relations between observable and latent variables and the actual stochastic process that generate the corrosion time series data. The proposed method consists of 3 main steps. Firstly, the latent and observed variable relations and the underlying stochastic processes governing the corrosion process were modelled by physics-informed regression models. The latent groupings that give rise to the observed time series were identified by using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method. Finally, the prediction algorithm based on the learned physic-informed regression model was proposed to forecast the process progression. We validated the model by a case study on a simulated corrosion process in oil and gas pipelines, in which both latent variables and ILI data were sampled from predefined distributions. The results indicated that the model could predict the growth of corrosion defects and capture the variance of the stochastic processes demonstrated by the low mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.0082%, 3.9532%, and 3.6831%, which corresponds to the three corrosion growth processes causes by three types of soil. The proposed model can be used to facilitate the development of reliability models and corrosion management.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088241","physics-informed corrosion growth model;latent variable model for time series;oil and gas pipelines","Corrosion;Oils;Pipelines;Time series analysis;Stochastic processes;Predictive models;Soil","corrosion;inspection;pattern clustering;pipelines;probability;regression analysis;reliability;stochastic processes;time series","actual stochastic process;buried pipelines;complex processes;corrosion defect;corrosion growth process;corrosion rate;corrosion time series data;gas pipelines;hidden physics-related variables;learned physic-informed regression model;mean growth path;physics-informed latent variable corrosion growth model;physics-informed latent variables;physics-informed regression models;pipeline corrosion management;probability distribution;process progression;simulated corrosion process;underlying stochastic processes;variable relations","","","","36","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this investigation, wind speed and generated power of wind turbines (PWT) historical data is used to predict the future amounts of PWT. It should be noted that the use of conventional methods which only use wind speed prediction to calculate the generated power, due to the presence of actuator faults, sudden changes in weather conditions, various disturbances, and other factors may lead to errors in the predictions. So, in this paper, the time-series method is used to merge the history of PWT with weather factors, instead of just wind speed data, to achieve precise estimations. Simulation results show the proposed method's efficiency and accuracy by applying it to a real dataset.","","978-1-6654-5285-4","10.1109/ICTEM56862.2023.10084233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10084233","energy management system;power forecasting;wind turbine;renewable energy;MLP Neural Network","Actuators;Wind speed;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Wind power generation;Wind turbines;History","battery storage plants;energy management systems;energy storage;load forecasting;power generation control;time series;wind power plants;wind turbines","actuator fault;battery energy storage systems;electric load forecasting;energy management systems;optimal usage;renewable energy sources;speed data;term forecasting;time-series method;weather conditions;weather factors;wind speed prediction;wind turbine-generated power;wind turbines historical data","","","","15","IEEE","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Integration of renewable energy into grids has resulted in cleaner and greener energy generation and distribution than the conventional fossil-fuel-based grids. However, the variability and asynchrony associated with the renewable-based generation pose security threats such as blackouts following major generation contingency events. Early identification of such serious network separation events is crucial for grid operators to take prompt action and avoid blackouts. To this end, this paper proposes a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) based artificial neural network model to forecast network bottlenecks in an early stage. The proposed model is further enhanced by the inclusion of stacked LSTM with more hidden layers than the conventional LSTM. The model is then implemented on a modified Southeast Australian (SA) Power System model with substantial renewable integration. All the dynamic simulations are conducted in the PSSE platform. This platform is also used for time series data mining. The model is then trained and validated on the constructed dataset concerning the real power system. In addition, several performance metrics are evaluated to check the performance of forecasting. The findings show that the model successfully detects and anticipates the tie line overflow during a major synchronous generator loss occurrence every time. Furthermore, all of the performance evaluation metrics validate the proposed model’s goodness of fit. Therefore, the proposed technique utilizing a generalized approach has the potential to be deployed as an effective tool for forecasting network separation events in low-inertia power grids.","","978-1-6654-7517-4","10.1109/ICONAT57137.2023.10080441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10080441","sustainable energy;LSTM;forecasting;blackout;ANN;frequency resilience;photovoltaic;wind","Renewable energy sources;Time series analysis;Power system stability;Predictive models;Synchronous generators;Stability analysis;Frequency measurement","data mining;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;power generation planning;power generation reliability;power grids;power system simulation;recurrent neural nets;synchronous generators;time series","artificial neural network model;blackouts;cleaner energy generation;conventional fossil-fuel-based grids;conventional LSTM;dynamic simulations;enhance frequency resilience;forecasting network separation events;greener energy generation;grid operators;hidden layers;Long-Short Term Memory;low-inertia power grids;modified Southeast Australian Power System model;network bottlenecks;performance evaluation metrics;performance metrics;prompt action;PSSE platform;PV;renewable energy;renewable-based generation;security threats;solar photovoltaic energy;stacked LSTM;substantial renewable integration;synchronous generator loss;time series data mining","","","","19","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposed a time-series model for forecasting PM2.5 in advance through a machine learning process with a linear and non-linear hybrid algorithm. A hybrid algorithm that brings together the capabilities of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to find the linear and nonlinear correlation of the PM2.5 time-series data. The proposed model is called ARIMA-FIS which uses the gradient descent (GD) method in the learning process. The dataset used in this research is the daily recorded of PM2.5 values in Rayong province, which is the industrial city in Thailand. The results showed that the ARIMA-FIS model had the best performance in forecasting PM2.5 in advance with the least error at 3.46 of mean absolute error (MAE) and 5.11 of root mean square error (RMSE).

A prediction model based on regression and the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model is developed in an effort to address the complexity of air quality prediction. The air quality dataset is obtained from Kaggle during the model's first round of data collecting. In the forecasting process, each element of air quality is seen as a time series of data. The air quality impacting elements, such as the data from nearby stations and meteorological data, are taken into account in the model. These include lead (Pb), ammonia, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (N O2), ozone (03), sulphur dioxide (S O2), nitrogen dioxide (N O2, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5. (NH3). Then, a novel method called the Expectation- Maximization algorithm is used to manage the missing values. The performance of the air quality indices is predicted and assessed using certain regression techniques. The most cutting-edge technology, XGBoost, is used to anticipate the severity of air quality based on the expected values. Then the performance is assessed using five performance metrices like accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The accuracy of the prediction data has significantly increased in this model when compared with previous models.","","979-8-3503-9844-1","10.1109/ACCTHPA57160.2023.10083379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083379","Time series model;Expectation Maximization algorithm;Regression models;Performance metrics;XGBoost","Analytical models;Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Air quality;Prediction algorithms","air pollution;air quality;environmental science computing;neural nets;nitrogen compounds;ozone;regression analysis;supervised learning;time series","air management;air quality dataset;air quality impacting elements;air quality indices;air quality prediction algorithms;CO/bin;cutting-edge technology;expectation- maximization algorithm;eXtreme gradient boosting;forecasting process;meteorological data;meteorological forecast;NH/bin;NO/bin;Pb/el;prediction data;prediction model;regression techniques;robust air quality prediction;SO/bin;sulphur dioxide;XGBoost model","","","","16","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Web traffic is the volume of data that visitors send and receive on a website, and historically, it has made up the majority of internet traffic. The ability to forecast internet traffic flow is totally dependent on historical and real-time traffic data collected from many sources that monitor network flow. One of the toughest issues in this area is the prediction of future time series values.

But They ignore the complex intrinsic features of the series (the characteristics of intra-period and inter-period variations). Based on the observation of the multi-periodicity of time series, this study extends the analysis of time series to a higher space by decomposing a complex 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple frequencies. Through this transformation, we connect the time series prediction to the computer vision so we can get more effective techniques which can be employed to extract complex temporal variations from the transformed 2D tensors. To address these issues, this paper proposes to combine the Transformer with a wavelet decomposition-based 2D feature learning module. The 2D feature learning module captures the complex period variations of the time series and the Transformer captures the long-term historical details. To more fully learn the periodic features, this paper proposes Dwtformer by referring to the auto-correlation mechanism in Autoformer.

Firstly, CEEMD decomposition is used to reduce the instability of wind speed series and improve its predictability. Then, the BILSTM-Transformer prediction model is established for each sub-sequence obtained by decomposition. The bidirectional long-term and short-term memory artificial neural network BILSTM is used to replace the positional encoding in the transformer to extract the position characteristics of the sequence, and then the encoders in the transformer are used for prediction.

To overcome these shortcomings, this work proposes a prediction framework based on non-linear fuzzy information granule (NFIG) series, which can boost the long-term performance of most predictors. Firstly, we propose the representation of NFIG for the first time, replacing the linear core lines with non-linear time-dependent curves. Secondly, we propose a temporal window splitting algorithm based on curvature equations and weighted directed graphs, which can not only merge temporal windows with the same trend but also cointegrate incremental data. Finally, the non-linear trend fuzzy granulation can be employed as a data preprocessing module for various time series predictors to achieve better long-term forecasting performance. As a typical time series forecasting task, the precise long-term forecast of traffic flow data can relieve the overburdened traffic system and improve the traffic environment to a certain extent.

This paper presents STEGNN: a novel spatial-temporal embedding graph neural network for road network forecasting. The key idea of STEGNN is utilizing Cosine Similarity to generate a high-quality temporal graph and thus fills the gap between the temporal-spatial correlations for traffic graph, which includes (i) a novel approach to construct temporal graph based on temporal-spatial similarity from traffic graphs, which is much more accurate on measured similarity of time series claimed by previous methods; (ii) an advanced spatial-temporal embedding model to exploit spatial-temporal dependencies by leveraging specific arrangements of temporal and spatial graphs; and (iii) an effective framework that gasps extensive spatial-temporal dependencies in the long-term by mixing multi-layer graph convolution with dilated convolution to understand wide-range spatial-temporal features.

However, accurate time series forecasting is challenging because real-world time series suffer from the distribution shift problem, where their statistical properties change over time. Despite extensive solutions to distribution shifts in domain adaptation or generalization, they fail to function effectively in unknown, constantly-changing distribution shifts, which are common in time series. In this paper, we propose Hyper TimeSeries Forecasting (HTSF), a hypernetwork-based framework for accurate time series forecasting under distribution shift. HTSF jointly learns the time-varying distributions and the corresponding forecasting models in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, HTSF exploits the hyper layers to learn the best characterization of the distribution shifts, generating the model parameters for the main layers to make accurate predictions. We implement HTSF as an extensible framework that can incorporate diverse time series forecasting models such as RNNs. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks demonstrate that HTSF achieves state-of-the-art performances.","2690-5965","978-1-6654-7315-6","10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077946","hypernetworks;time series forecasting;distribution shift","Training;Adaptation models;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Benchmark testing;Air quality;Distance measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;time series","accurate time series forecasting;corresponding forecasting models;distribution shift problem;diverse time series forecasting models;HTSF;real-world time series;time-varying distributions;TimeSeries Forecasting","","","","45","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In situ measurements often pose limitations in determining these factors. Alternatively, remote sensing technologies may be employed in setting up offshore wind farms. This paper presents a satellite based methodology for retrieval and forecasting of wind speed in the Kakinada coast of Andhra Pradesh. For this, the level-2 Ocean (OCN) product is used from the Copernicus satellite (Sentinel-1) that contains wind retrieval information.

The performance of communications in 5GV2V networks is often affected by harsh weather conditions, such as rain, snow, sand, and dust, and the impact could be to a large extent. Therefore, it is crucial to have a precise forecasting model for the automated driving system to prepare for performance degradation in advance. In this paper, we use NS-3 to simulate the 5G mm-Wave V2V signal strength under different weather conditions. Weather conditions are represented as time series data, and we propose using various statistical or machine learning forecasting models to predict 5G mm-Wave signal strength. The forecasting models we evaluate in this paper include auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Meta Prophet, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Our evaluation results show that LSTM is the best forecasting model for 5GV2V signal strength under harsh weather.","","978-1-6654-5719-4","10.1109/ICNC57223.2023.10074369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074369","5G;V2V Network;Forecasting Model;Machine Learning","5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Snow;Time series analysis;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Transportation;Predictive models","5G mobile communication;autoregressive moving average processes;forecasting theory;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;time series;vehicular ad hoc networks","5G mm-Wave signal strength;5G mm-Wave V2V signal strength;5G V2V Networks;5GV2V networks;5GV2V signal strength;automated driving system;different time series forecasting models;harsh weather conditions;high data transfer rates;millimeter waves;precise forecasting model;statistical machine learning forecasting models;time series data;Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications","","","","20","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presence of net metered (NM) loads can further complicate accurate demand forecasting. For these loads only the net demand, difference of load demand and generation, is available. This paper presents the various stages observed during microgrid restoration with high penetration of NM loads. Disaggregation of demand and generation from the net metered time series is shown to be essential for accurate demand forecasting in each of these stages. A disaggregation approach is proposed using correlation in the net metered data. Time series analysis is then used to forecast the demand in each stage of the microgrid restoration process. A case study using demand and generation time series data from residential loads, shows that the proposed approach is significantly more accurate for demand forecasting than using only the net-metered time series.","2472-8152","978-1-6654-5355-4","10.1109/ISGT51731.2023.10066395","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066395","Demand Forecasting;Microgrids;Power system restoration;Time series analysis","Meters;Correlation;Time series analysis;Demand forecasting;Estimation;Microgrids;Smart grids","demand forecasting;distributed power generation;power engineering computing;time series","accurate demand forecasting;demand estimation;frequency instability;generation time series data;islanded mode;load demand;microgrid restoration process;microgrids;net demand;net metered data;net metered loads;net metered time series;NM loads;residential loads;significant demand generation imbalance;time series analysis","","","","16","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The incoming data are used to periodically re-train the models and update forecast snapshots over a moving horizon window. However, such frameworks are not resilient to disruptions in data availability caused by losses in communications between the field sensors and data loggers. This paper bridges the shortcoming by leveraging a previously proposed forecasting framework that is resilient to abrupt changes in data quality caused by communication losses. Assuming no availability of real-time field system data, which is typical in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, the framework uses lightweight recursive time-series models to independently forecast solar irradiance, ambient temperature, PV power, and consumer load for three horizon windows: 24 hours, 12 hours, and 1 hour. Four types of ensemble-based regression trees-simple gradient boosted trees (GBR), GBR with an adaptive component (A-GBR), random forests (RF), and extra trees (ExTR)-are leveraged and their performances are compared against a simple historical weekly mean. Numerical results show that A-GBR performs better on average by 32% for 24-hour horizon and 39% for 12-hour horizon, whereas ExTR outdoes the other models on average by 10% for 1-hour horizon.","2472-8152","978-1-6654-5355-4","10.1109/ISGT51731.2023.10066445","U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC05-000R22725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066445","univariate forecasting;time series;extreme weather;no real-time data;blind forecast","Photovoltaic systems;Adaptation models;Temperature distribution;Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Data models","data loggers;distributed power generation;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;random forests;regression analysis;time series;trees (mathematics)","1-hour horizon;12-hour horizon;24-hour horizon;communication losses;consumer load;data availability;data loggers;data quality;ensemble-based regression trees-simple gradient;extra trees;extreme weather events;field sensors;forecast snapshots;forecasting framework;horizon windows;lightweight recursive time-series models;microgrids;moving horizon window;near-continuous availability;PV power;real-time field system data;real-time predictors;recursive blind forecasting;time 1.0 hour;time 12.0 hour;time 24.0 hour;time-series photovoltaic generation","","","","9","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the difficulty in capturing nonlinear features, traditional forecasting methods usually fail to achieve high prediction performance for resource usage and workload sequences. Besides, there is much noise in original time series of resources and workloads. If these time series are not de-noised by smoothing algorithms, the prediction results can fail to meet the providers' requirements. To do so, this work proposes a hybrid prediction model named VAMBiG that integrates Variational mode decomposition, an Adaptive Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter, a Multi-head attention mechanism, Bidirectional and Grid versions of Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. VAMBiG adopts a signal decomposition method named variational mode decomposition to decompose complex and non-linear original time series into low-frequency intrinsic mode functions. Then, it adopts an adaptive SG filter as a data pre-processing tool to eliminate noise and extreme points in such functions. Afterwards, it adopts bidirectional and grid LSTM networks to capture bidirectional features and dimension ones, respectively. Finally, it adopts a multi-head attention mechanism to explore importance of different data dimensions. VAMBiG aims to predict resource usage and workloads in highly variable traces in clouds. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that it achieves higher-accuracy prediction than several advanced prediction approaches with datasets from Google and Alibaba cluster traces.","2377-3782","","10.1109/TSUSC.2023.3259522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077424","Cloud data centers;deep learning;LSTM;adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter;attention mechanisms","Time series analysis;Predictive models;Forecasting;Feature extraction;Data mining;Cloud computing;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
