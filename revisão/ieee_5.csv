Recent advances in temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in multivariate time series forecasting due to their ability to characterize high-dimensional nonlinear correlations and temporal patterns. However, the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) constitutes serious concerns about using these models to make decisions in real-world applications. Currently, how to defend multivariate forecasting models, especially temporal GNNs, is overlooked. The existing adversarial defense studies are mostly in static and single-instance classification domains, which cannot apply to forecasting due to the generalization challenge and the contradiction issue. To bridge this gap, we propose an adversarial danger identification method for temporally dynamic graphs to effectively protect GNN-based forecasting models. Our method consists of three steps: 1) a hybrid GNN-based classifier to identify dangerous times; 2) approximate linear error propagation to identify the dangerous variates based on the high-dimensional linearity of DNNs; and 3) a scatter filter controlled by the two identification processes to reform time series with reduced feature erasure. Our experiments, including four adversarial attack methods and four state-of-the-art forecasting models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in defending forecasting models against adversarial attacks.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3252175","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; NSFC-FRQSC Research Program on Smart Cities and Big Data; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068359","Adversarial attack;filter-based defense;graph neural network (GNN);multivariate time series forecasting","Forecasting;Predictive models;Time series analysis;Perturbation methods;Graph neural networks;Correlation;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Each day, more than thousands of passengers are recorded by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to ride the MRT3 and predicting the number of passengers per day can be quite difficult. The ridership of the MRT3 varies daily due to factors such as holidays, working days, and even sudden technical issues. Commuters do not know how many other commuters will board on a certain day and this could lead to difficulty in planning a convenient journey to a destination. Currently, the DOTr relies on historical data plotted on spreadsheets and this can be quite difficult to analyze. In this research, a time series forecasting of daily ridership predicts the future ridership in a specific station on certain days is proposed.

Analyzing high-dimensional data with spatial and temporal dependencies is pointed out as a major challenge for traditional machine learning approaches for air pollution forecasting. The unprecedented advances in deep learning employed on massive quantities of IoT sensor data raise high hopes for the future of air pollution forecasting. Drawing on past and current experiences and solutions advanced in a growing body of research on the topic, we proposed and evaluated four encoder-decoder architectures with attention for forecasting particulate matter (PM) levels, with a general applicability that is both location- and season-independent. The attention mechanism was employed to better learn representation of time series data. By selectively focusing the attention on elements that contribute the most, superior performance gains have been obtained by the proposed models. Sensor measurements obtained in the past 7 or 14 days as well a set of external factors known to affect the pollutant levels, such as weather conditions, location and time frame (e.g., season, time of day) were taken into account. In this research, we carried out a case study on PM2.5 forecasting for the city of Skopje, allowing us to discuss the relevance of the results obtained by the proposed solutions. The ability to draw valid inferences from data has critical importance when forecasting air pollution. In this respect, any air pollution forecasting model based on deep learning would require a component for generation of realistic data samples to augment the time series dataset. We address the challenges in missing data by proposing and evaluating two adversarial networks for data augmentation. We have conducted a number of experiments to investigate the performance of the predictive models with and without augmenting the training datasets and obtain superior performance gains by the proposed adversarial models for data augmentation. The deep neural architectures advanced in this research are general enough to be used for predictive and generative tasks for other pollutants; moreover, they could be adopted for related tasks handling time series data in other domains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057411","Adversarial Data Augmentation;Air Pollution Monitoring;Air Pollution Prediction;Augmenting Sensor Data;Deep Learning;Generative Adversarial Networks;Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks","Forecasting;Predictive models;Air pollution;Atmospheric modeling;Data models;Task analysis;Pollution measurement","","","","1","","","CCBY","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is highly essential to guarantee QoS (Quality of Service) and to fulfill SLA (Service Level Agreement), in particular for the services having strict QoS needs like web servers getting a heavy load. Over-provisioning occurs when there is low demand, under-provisioning when there is a high demand and both of these situations result in poor quality of Experience (QoE) for the users. So, an approach is required to forecast future workload accurately prior to the resource allocation so that the right amount of resources can be provisioned. Such a system can help CSPs to achieve efficient resource allocation that maximizes their economic growth and also gains users’ satisfaction. This article presents an efficient workload forecasting mechanism built with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique to evaluate the number of resources required using web server workload time series data and queuing theory. The main goal of this technique is to forecast the future workload of the web server and predict the resources required to minimize the latency while reducing infrastructure costs and energy consumption. Normalization and outlier removal are performed for better forecasting. Various other techniques are also compared in estimating workload. Forecasting of load and prediction of resources is done with good accuracy by our proposed model better than many other models.","","978-1-6654-7451-1","10.1109/IDCIoT56793.2023.10053532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053532","Server workload;Time series;Cloud resources;Support Vector Regression;Queuing model","Cloud computing;Quality of service;Predictive models;Data models;Web servers;Resource management;Quality of experience","cloud computing;contracts;cost reduction;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);power aware computing;quality of experience;quality of service;queueing theory;regression analysis;resource allocation;support vector machines;time series","cloud resource forecasting;cloud service providers;CSPs;economic growth;elastic services;energy consumption;infrastructure cost reduction;ML techniques;outlier removal;over-provisioning;QoE;QoS;quality of experience;quality of service;queuing theory;resource allocation;resource provisioning;service demand;service level agreement;SLA;support vector regression;SVR;under-provisioning;user satisfaction;Web server workload time series data;workload estimation;workload forecasting","","","","15","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to the challenges in NLP and CV, time series problems not only add the complexity of order or temporal dependence among input sequences but also consider trend, level, and seasonality information that much of this data is valuable for decision making.

While previous methods have shown promise for accurately modeling contaminants of concern at DOE sites, some contaminants, such as hexavalent chromium, remain a challenge to model due to the high variability and frequency of data collection. Recent Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown promise to automatically handle these limitations, and regression-based ML models specifically have the potential to overcome these issues due to their ability to detect seasonal trends and patterns unapparent under simple visual inspection. This study focuses on several Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)-based models, such as traditional ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA, for modeling hexavalent chromium across 488 wells within the Hanford Site's 100-area from 1997 to 2022. After preprocessing by resampling the data to regular, monthly intervals and performing linear interpolation and normalization, we demonstrate the ARIMA models' predictive capabilities with time-series visualizations on training and testing data, as well as the models' forecasting results through 2024. The collected data sets enhance the ARIMA-based models' understanding of contaminant fate and transport at the Hanford site, which yields more reliable forecasts. There is potential for this data to be used to optimize pump and treat operations in terms of identifying appropriate periods of time and wells to recover the greatest amount of hexavalent chromium from the subsurface.","","979-8-3503-9696-6","10.1109/ICAIC57335.2023.10044126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044126","Groundwater;Contamination;Prediction;ARIMA;Machine Learning;Optimization","Training;Visualization;Chromium;Predictive models;Market research;Data models;Reliability","autoregressive moving average processes;contamination;environmental management;forecasting theory;groundwater;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;time series","accurately modeling contaminants;ARIMA model;ARIMA models;ARIMA-based models;Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average-based models;collected data sets;contaminant fate;data collection;decommissioned nuclear production facility;DOE sites;groundwater contamination detection;groundwater levels;Hanford Site;Hanford site;hexavalent chromium;monthly intervals;performing linear interpolation;regression-based ML models;remediation efforts;Seasonal trend assessment;seasonal trends;simple visual inspection;testing data;vital task","","","","11","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among various factors considered in selecting an appropriate forecasting tool, accuracy is known as the most important criterion. Therefore, the most critical issue in recent forecasting studies is related to improving forecasting accuracy. These studies can be generally categorized into two categories of proposing new single models and developing hybrid models. It has been proven from both theoretical and empirical points of view that combining different models can generate superior results and improve single models' predictive performance. However, despite the popularity and the widespread use of hybrid models, some influential factors, such as the structure of hybridization, number of components, type of components, etc., affect hybrid models' performance that must be appropriately chosen by designers. It is the most challenging subject in the literature of time series forecasting in two recent decades. Several researchers examine different combinations of these factors in order to conclude which one is better. In this way, several different papers have been published in hybridization literature; however, none can prove that its proposed structure is universally better than others. Thus, this paper's primary purpose is to propose an optimal hybrid structure for time series forecasting. The proposed structure's main idea is to simultaneously use remarkable features of series and parallel structures and lift their limitations by hybridization of these two methodologies. In this way, in some parts of the modeling process, parallel structure is used, and in some other parts, the series structure is used. In this paper, a bi-component hybrid model of statistical classic and artificial intelligence models is presented as the initial implementation of the proposed methodology. Its performance is theoretically and empirically evaluated. The optimality of the proposed structure is mathematically demonstrated from the theoretical point of view. It is universally proven that the constructed hybrid model based on the proposed structure will achieve the best performance among all other hybrid models constructed based on series and parallel structures by the same conditions, e.g., number and type of components. In addition, the empirical results of ten benchmark data sets with different characteristics indicate that the profitability of the proposed structure is statistically significant.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2022.3231008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015860","Hybridization structures;series and parallel hybrid structures;time series modeling and forecasting","Forecasting;Predictive models;Load modeling;Time series analysis;Numerical models;Analytical models;Support vector machines","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Most of the approaches proposed in the literature consist of embedded methods through the use of hidden layers added to the neural network architecture that modify the weights of the units associated with each input attribute so that the worst attributes have less weight in the learning process. Other approaches used for deep learning are filter methods, which are independent of the learning algorithm, which can limit the precision of the prediction model. Wrapper methods are impractical with deep learning due to their high computational cost. In this article, we propose new attribute subset evaluation FS methods for deep learning of the wrapper, filter and wrapper-filter hybrid types, where multiobjective and many-objective evolutionary algorithms are used as search strategies. A novel surrogate-assisted approach is used to reduce the high computational cost of the wrapper-type objective function, while the filter-type objective functions are based on correlation and an adaptation of the reliefF algorithm.

This work evaluates an autoregressive, computationally-light KNN-regression scheme (TSFKNN) for hourly, day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance and energy yield of various PV technologies. The model is being tested and validated using data measured in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. The available measured records span a 60-month period. The developed forecasting models are designed for online systems and provide increased levels of accuracy and low computational cost. Several parametric and nonparametric specifications, coupled with conventional versus outlier-robust estimation procedures are tested, in order to derive an optimal month-specific daily profile (MDP).

A reliable forecast is essential to optimize production and maintain grid stability. However, dynamics of power generation and consumption in modern grids are becoming increasingly difficult to predict due to dependencies on meteorological and socio-economic factors. Here we present a new data analysis framework designed to overcome such complexity. The forecast itself is generated using nonlinear time series analysis combined with machine learning. However, to reduce complexity, the forecast is made either by strictly univariate analysis or after filtering by causal interference analysis. The method thus provides good forecasts even for complex, high-dimensional situations in which classic methods usually fail.

In the context of the growing importance of vaccination, we need to rationalize the distribution of vaccines to central hospitals, community hospitals and health centers, taking into account the need and cost of vaccination. First, in order to predict the national daily vaccination figures for the next three months, we consulted relevant website data to obtain the vaccination figures for each day since the vaccination began in March 2021, and made the forecast for the next three months through the time series prediction method LSTM [3], [4]. Combined with the increment of the number of daily vaccinations as the label value, the final prediction results were obtained. Second, we first collected data and analyzed and processed the characteristics. Through collinearity analysis [5], we found that the number of residents and the number of medical personnel had strong collinearity, and the logarithm of the number of residents was calculated with log10. Then AHP [6] was used to analyze the impact of the number of nearby residents, convenient transportation, number of medical personnel, vaccine storage and transportation costs on vaccine distribution, and CR index was used to evaluate our model. The third question is to substitute the collected data of the two regions into the model of the previous question, and we subtract 10% number of nearby residents from the index of central hospitals as a penalty for crowd gathering.

Moreover, as the population is sky-rocketing, the demand for energy and water is increasing more rapidly than a decade before. Therefore, ensuring a steady clean water supply with optimized energy and water consumption has become necessary. To accurately monitor water distribution systems, the accuracy of input data plays a vital role in determining how accurate the system’s status estimations are. There must be a way for system operators to know what is going on at any given time to make practical decisions about how reliable the data they are receiving is. The input data uncertainty can induce flow and pressure calculation inaccuracies, which can be fatal while planning for future demands and needs to be quantified.Knowing the degree of uncertainty in predicting the water distribution system’s capacity or load can help people better prepare for future capacity or load predictions. Accurate uncertainty calculations are critical to time series forecasting. Probabilistic formulae are widely employed with classical time series models to estimate uncertainty. But incorporating new data and fine-tuning these models is a challenging task. This research paper presents a Bayesian LSTM network that computes both time series prediction and uncertainty assessment at the same time. In this paper, a real-time data set from VCU’s OpenCity test bed is employed to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested strategy.","","978-1-6654-7477-1","10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185529","bayesian LSTM;uncertainty estimation;smart cities;smart water distribution system","Uncertainty;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Sociology;Bayes methods;Task analysis","belief networks;energy consumption;load forecasting;real-time systems;recurrent neural nets;smart cities;time series;water supply","Bayesian LSTM approach;classical time series prediction model;degree of uncertainty;energy consumption;energy demand;high service standards;input data uncertainty;load predictions;modern smart city;predictive analysis;real-time data set;sky-rocketing;smart water distribution system;steady clean water supply;time series forecasting;uncertainty assessment;VCU's OpenCity test;water consumption","","","","27","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to prevent and control urban air pollution problems, it is necessary to understand the causes of air pollution and accurately grasp the changing trend of air quality (AQI). However, when traditional multiple linear regression and time series models predict AQI, there are some problems such as incomplete information utilization and low prediction accuracy. Based on this, the paper puts forward an AQI prediction method based on multiple time series (ARMAX). In the method, the lag order of AQI influencing factors in time series is introduced into the regression term, the residual series information is extracted, and the AQI prediction model is established. Taking Shijiazhuang city as an example, the data of AQI and its influencing factors from October 2013 to May 2022 in Shijiazhuang were collected. After preprocessing the data, the multiple linear regression model, the single time series model and the ARMAX model were used to fit and predict the data.

In a parallel dimension, the problem of decreasing CO2 emissions in smart cities is becoming a priority. Forecasting energy consumption is essential for implementing a decarbonization plan in a smart city. The energy consumption forecasting problem has some challenges because of lacking appropriate data, including energy consumption patterns in the energy sector. In such a context, in this study, we focus on short-term time series forecasting for energy consumption tasks with comprehensive data. We employed LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and hybrid models to predict energy consumption via time series. The models were tested on the JERICHO-E-usage Germany dataset for Berlin, Düsseldorf, and the whole of Germany.

The performance of the model is evaluated from the biases, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients between model forecast and observed TEC. The results show that bias remains between -3 to +3 TECU and +2 to-4 during quiet and disturbed days, respectively. The corresponding RMSE values are within a limit of 5 TECU and 6 TECU.

The OWT is first used to decompose the offshore wind speed series into low-frequency sub-series and high-frequency sub-series to reduce the impact of volatility. The LSTM model is used to predict the high frequency subseries, and the ARIMA model is used to predict the low frequency subseries. Then the prediction results are fused to form a complete prediction of the offshore wind speed series.

In addition, the difference between residential load and wind power generation is taken as the objective function for optimal power consumption.

One of the key issues of such scenario based long-term planning is the acquisition of short-term load and renewable energy output. Obtaining typical day data based on clustering algorithm can ensure the dynamic typicality of typical day data, but it cannot guarantee the overall accuracy of the set of typical days in the annual sense. This paper first gives the index to measure the overall accuracy of typical days, and then based on the dynamic time wraping distance nearest neighbor algorithm, a typical day acquisition method based on the specified sample classes is proposed. Through the maximum and minimum designated sample classes and binary classification algorithm proposed in this paper, and combined with the dynamic time wraping distance nearest neighbor algorithm, it can not only obtain the dynamic characteristics of typical days, but also ensure the typical day acquisition requirements of the annual overall accuracy index.

Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a similar interest in developing accurate models to forecast solar photovoltaic (PV) power production. Such models vary depending on the geographical location of PV sites and the seasons considered. The Philippines has yet to have a solar PV output forecasting model adapted to the country's local conditions. This study aims to evaluate the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) forecasting model as a tool for forecasting solar PV generation based on the seasonal characteristics of the country and identify which input parameters are significant for each season. This work used solar PV production data as an endogenous variable. Meanwhile, exogenous variables include in-situ solar irradiance data from solar power plants; and cloud cover, wind speed and direction, ambient temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity, which we extracted from ERA5 Reanalysis data. Datasets were divided based on the seasons as defined by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), namely, hot dry (HD), rainy (R), and cold dry (CD) seasons. Then, we performed a forecast on each season and one full year to assess the performance of the SARIMAX model. The best model per season was done based on the forecasting accuracy measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This work analyzed seasonal and year-round SARIMAX models for Baguio City, Philippines. Results show that the cold dry season got the highest accuracy value in terms of 2.26 MAE and 4.06 RMSE. Meanwhile, the rainy season had the lowest accuracy of 12.91 MAE and 16.16 RMSE. We can infer from our findings that seasonal forecasting is better during hot dry and cold dry seasons. We also found that the year-round forecasting model performs better than the rainy season model. From the significant parameters identified in our best models, our analysis showed that wind direction can be removed from all models; irradiation and relative humidity were significant for all seasons.","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113538","forecasting;seasonality;SARIMAX;solar PV;Philippines","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Wind speed;Urban areas;Production;Climate change","autoregressive moving average processes;load forecasting;mean square error methods;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;regression analysis;solar power;solar power stations;time series","Baguio City;cold dry season;Exogenous Variables forecasting model;forecast solar photovoltaic power production;forecasting accuracy;in-situ solar irradiance data;Philippines;PV sites;rainy season model;SARIMAX model;Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average;seasonal characteristics;seasonal forecasting;solar energy;solar power plants;solar PV generation;solar PV output forecasting model;solar PV power output forecasting;solar PV production data;year-round forecasting model;year-round SARIMAX models","","","","28","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the biggest challenge in producing solar energy is the unpredictable intermittent power output of PV systems, which is mostly caused by weather conditions. This variation in power generation usually causes significant economic loss. Accurate forecasting of output power a day ahead or hourly ahead is the efficient way for the management of the power production. This paper offers a dependable short-term, hourly-ahead forecasting method of PV power generation for the delivery and storage mostly for the grid optimization. A long short-term memory (LSTM)- based deep learning method is used for its dependability for the long data along with feature of time series data. The historical dataset in between 1990-2013 in Australian locations were used. By appropriately functioning dependent features with the independent features a correlation between them is developed. This resulted in excellent power output forecast of RMSE 0.27%. The accuracy of this simple system is much better than the recently proposed more complex hybrid system like LSTM+CNN, LSTM+SVM+RNN.","","978-1-6654-9045-0","10.1109/STI56238.2022.10103310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103310","forecasting;deep learning;solar energy;reliability;long short-term memory;renewable energy sources;accuracy","Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy sources;Correlation;Time series analysis;Solar energy;Production;Predictive models","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;support vector machines;time series","appealing qualities;attention worldwide;deep learning method;dependable short-term;dependent features;excellent power output forecast;hourly-ahead forecasting method;long data;LSTM machine learning algorithm;LSTM+CNN;LSTM+SVM+RNN;output power;power production;PV power generation;PV systems;short-term memory;significant economic loss;solar energy;solar photovoltaic energy generation;solar photovoltaic output energy;time series data;unpredictable intermittent power output;weather conditions","","","","20","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Asset Trading Strategies Based on LSTM - Bitcoin and Gold as an Example","H. Huang; T.

Thus, this paper constructs an investment model and helps investors to adopt a reasonable investment strategy. Firstly, to determine an investment strategy you must first make a forecast of asset movement. We have taken a variety of forecasting models using Bitcoin and gold daily data as examples. LSTM GRU and ARIMA are established and trained with the past price data, and these models are useful in predicting the trend of time series data. The LSTM obtains the optimal prediction model with MAE equal to 0.04. Secondly, we consider the return and risk indicators in discussing the best trading strategy. To quantify the risk indicator, GARCH, a risk scoring system, was used to perform risk assessment, and the return indicator is quantified using the predicted rate of return. Then Sharpe Ratio is constructed from the income and risk indexes based on the idea of maximization of return per risk, which is rational since every investor must balance the relationship between return and risk in portfolio construction. Further, PSO is used to search for optimum, which reached 27 263 in 9/10/2021 value, equivalent to an annualized yield of 93.68% with an overall VAR value of 502.51. To test the effectiveness of our strategy, we adopted Data Envelopment Analysis, a multi-stage portfolio evaluation model to prove the effectiveness of the trading strategy. Finally, we did a sensitivity analysis of the results. This process saves investors from different cost functions and highlights the best strategy.","","978-3-8007-6025-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104432","","","","","","","","","","19 Apr 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In order to further improve the forecasting accuracy, this paper proposed two combined forecasting models, SVM-gray system and SVMArima, based on the time series characteristics of power load curves. By analyzing the principles of the two traditional forecasting models, the grey system and Arima, it’s found that the dispersion coefficient of the historical data of the load to be forecasted and the average slope difference of the daily load to be forecasted have a greater impact on the forecast errors of the grey system and the Arima model, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the grey system increases with the decrease of the discrete coefficient of the historical data of the load to be predicted, and the prediction accuracy of the Arima model increases with the decrease of the average slope difference of the load to be predicted. Therefore, the two prediction models are combined with the SVM model while the prediction accuracy is high, that is, the daily load with a small discrete coefficient of the historical data of the load to be predicted is selected as the experimental data, and the grey system-SVM combined prediction model is used for prediction. The daily load with small average slope difference of the load to be predicted is selected as the experimental data, and the ARIMA-SVM combined prediction model is used for prediction. The combined model uses the variance-covariance method (MV) to determine the weight coefficient, and the prediction results of the single prediction model are weighted and averaged to obtain the predicted value of the combined model. Finally, the load data of Anchorage, Alaska is taken as an example to verify. While the discrete coefficient of the historical data of the load to be predicted is low, the prediction accuracy of the grey system-SVM combined prediction model is higher. While the average slope difference of the load to be predicted is low, the prediction accuracy of the SVM-Arima combined prediction model is higher, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-1-6654-8915-7","10.1109/PSET56192.2022.10100588","Zhengzhou University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100588","short-term load forecasting;time series characteristics;grey model;auto regressive integrated moving average model;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Analytical models;Load forecasting;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models;Power systems","autoregressive moving average processes;forecasting theory;grey systems;load forecasting;power engineering computing;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series","Arima model increases;ARIMA-SVM combined prediction model;average slope difference;combined forecasting models;daily load;different forecasting accuracy;different load forecasting models;discrete coefficient;forecast errors;forecasting model;grey system increases;grey system-SVM combined prediction model;historical data;power load curve;prediction accuracy;prediction models;single prediction model;SVM model;SVM-Arima combined prediction model;SVM-gray system;time series characteristics;traditional forecasting models","","","","14","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the daily fluctuations of traffic flow patterns and the excellent performance of recurrent neural networks in time series analysis, a deep learning algorithm named time slot recurrent neural networks (TS-RNN) is proposed to predict future traffic flow by learning multiple sub-patterns instead of a complete traffic flow pattern. The historical series data were break into groups according to their time slot, and the optimal grouping size was determined by grid searching algorithm. Removing irrelevant historical time series data can effectively reduce noise and interference during learning, so that each independent sub-mode only needs to be trained on highly correlated data and learns fewer but more accurate feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a piecewise pattern has been used in time series forecasting. The comparison results with six traffic flow prediction models suggest that the performance of proposed model is far superior than those of comparison models due to the more powerful and accurate time series pattern learning and representing ability. Furthermore, small-scale models can also make full use of computing resources, improve the parallel computing capabilities and achieve real-time online prediction.","","978-1-6654-6007-1","10.1109/ICITE56321.2022.10101423","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101423","intelligence transportation system;traffic state prediction;time series;deep learning;small scale pattern","Recurrent neural networks;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Transportation;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models","deep learning (artificial intelligence);intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;time series;traffic engineering computing","accurate short-term traffic flow prediction;accurate time series pattern learning;complete traffic flow pattern;deep learning algorithm named time slot recurrent neural networks;fewer but more accurate feature representations;future traffic flow;grid searching algorithm;highly correlated data;historical series data;intelligent transportation systems;irrelevant historical time series data;multiple sub-patterns;optimal grouping size;piecewise pattern;powerful time series pattern learning;representing ability;time series analysis;time series forecasting;traffic flow patterns;traffic flow prediction models","","","","24","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the short-term URT passenger flow data is neither linear nor stationary, which results in the inaccuracy of prediction using only single deep-learning models. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model that integrates Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to achieve faster and better results for short-term passenger flow prediction. The approach contains four steps. First, the EEMD algorithm decomposes passenger flow data into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and a residual function. Second, the Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients were used to examine the IMF components to select components that are highly related to the URT passenger flow. Third, the selected features and historical passenger flow are combined as inputs for the GRU model, respectively. Last, the outputs of each input feature and historical data were synthesized to obtain the result. We used the passenger flow of Xipu, a station of Chengdu Metro Line 2, to demonstrate the method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed EEMD-GRU architecture, compared with benchmark models, achieves superior performance. It can reduce the training time by 26.18% and improve the average accuracy by 29.58%, which shows great validity for large-scale short-term metro passenger flow forecasting.","","978-1-6654-6007-1","10.1109/ICITE56321.2022.10101458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101458","Urban Rail Transit (URT);short-term passenger flow;forecast;EEMD;GRU;deep learning","Rails;Training;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Predictive models","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Hilbert transforms;railway engineering;recurrent neural nets","Chengdu Metro Line 2 station;deep-learning models;EEMD-based GRU model;ensemble empirical mode decomposition-based gated recurrent unit model;historical passenger flow;Kendall correlation coefficient;short-term metro passenger flow forecasting;short-term metro passenger flow prediction;short-term URT passenger flow data;Spearman correlation coefficient;urban rail transit organizations","","","","26","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These settings work only for uncorrelated pre-change variables. With our geometric version of the tests via clustering, we can test the hypothesis that we can improve state-of-the-art settings for QHD, by combining QCD and QHD simultaneously, as well as including information about pre-change time-evolution in correlations. We can work with correlated pre-change variables and test if the time-evolution of correlation improves performance. We prove test consistency and design test hypothesis based on clustering performance. We apply this solution to financial time series correlations. Future developments on this topic are highly relevant in finance for Risk Management, Portfolio Management, and Market Shocks Forecasting which can save billions of dollars for the global economy.

Because of the financial crisis, it is now essential to estimate stock values accurately in order to make money. Non-linear signal forecasting requires sophisticated statistical models and machine learning methods. We must identify the stock’s purchasing and selling points for a specific stock market history in order to make a profit. The Dow Theory, MACD, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Exponential Moving Average, and others have all been used to forecast stock market performance. It could be challenging to make a specific judgement because these models could provide a variety of indications. The aforementioned issue was attempted to be solved by a wave of machine learning algorithms in artificial intelligence. Some strategies have yet to provide promising results, while others have not reacted as well on the stock market exchange, due to the non-linear structure of the stock market signals. We intend to employ the Prophet model, which is reliable and generates findings with minimal data. The Prophet refers to the method of forecasting time series data based on an additive model with non-linear trends suited with holiday impacts, daily seasonality, weekly, and yearly. Strong seasonal impacts in time-series data are ideal for it. The prophet is resilient to missing data and adept at handling outliers.

This is advantageous for the practice of revenue management because the forecast serves as the foundation for determining the cost of each flight. In order to maximize profit, it is therefore important to know whether these forecasts are accurate. Today, the price of an airline ticket can vary significantly and quickly during the same journey, even for neighboring seats in the same cabin. Customers search for the greatest offer while airlines seek to maintain a high overall revenue and maximize their profit. Airlines use a range of computational techniques, including as pricing discrimination and demand forecasting, to increase their revenue. Demand forecasts have a crucial role in how well airline pricing and revenue management systems perform. The demand for different fare classes is assumed independent by traditional airline forecasting models, which ignore the demand's sensitivity to the airline's inventory control procedures, price variations, and the range of available alternatives. This study looks at several forecasting algorithm implementations in the context of sales booking prediction for the aviation sector, along with its benefits and drawbacks. The research is accompanied with use cases in which Time Series forecasting algorithms ARIMA and Random Forest are tested against a passenger data for American Airlines against performance indicators: confidence interval, usability, and performance. Academics, business intelligence and revenue analysts, airline operators, the revenue management team, and functional silos across the organization are the main beneficiaries of this article as sales forecast will be utilized to plan and budget flights (capacity) and to make strategic decision.","","978-1-6654-5305-9","10.1109/CSDE56538.2022.10089361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089361","Machine Learning;Airline Forward Sales Forecast;Neural Network;Smart Revenue Management;ARIMA;Regression","Technological innovation;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Pricing;Prediction algorithms;Business intelligence","forecasting theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;profitability;random forests;sales management;time series;travel industry","airline forward sales forecast;airline operators;airline pricing;airline ticket;American Airlines;ARIMA;aviation industry;demand forecasting;forecasting algorithm implementations;machine learning;price variations;pricing discrimination;random forest;revenue management team;sales booking prediction;time series forecasting;traditional airline forecasting models","","","","33","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Insurance policy, land leasing, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasts utilize spatial variability crop-type information to predict crop acreage for a range of monitoring and decision-making purposes. Cropland products derived from remote sensing have become much more accurate in depicting the location and size of agricultural fields. However, differentiating between actively agricultural areas and probably followed fields across agricultural lands, particularly in temperate zone grass barren structures, has received little attention. Crop-fallow rotation techniques are extensively utilized for soil fertility regeneration in the Sahel, one of the world's biggest dryland areas. Nevertheless, since fallow fields aren't clearly distinguished even within cropland class in any current remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, irrespective of the geographical resolution, nothing is recognized about their size. As one of the most precise metrics for evaluating regression modelling, the recently created Random Forest (RF) machine-learning method has gained widespread recognition. One study sought to determine whether the RF regression algorithm could be used to estimate crop solar energy digitally, assess a system's implementation, and compare the RF algorithm's productivity to the existing benchmarks.

In this work, we propose a simple and effective method (termed WLP-ForGAN) for watershed multi-point Water Level Prediction based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. Through the adversarial training of the generator and discriminator, the predicted data is constantly close to the real data, to realize the prediction of time series, and improve the utilization of limited data information of the model. The attention module is embedded in the WLP-ForGAN network structure of the generator and discriminator, so that the WLP-ForGAN model can autonomously assign the attention weight value to the input series vectors according to the hydrological information in the input features. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that the proposed WLP-ForGAN consistently outperforms commonly used models, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2474-3828","979-8-3503-1015-3","10.1109/ITME56794.2022.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10086140","Water Level Prediction;Time Series Prediction;Generative Adversarial Networks;Forecasting.","Water;Training;Recurrent neural networks;Time series analysis;Watersheds;Predictive models;Feature extraction","deep learning (artificial intelligence);disasters;floods;geophysics computing;recurrent neural nets;time series;water resources;watersheds","adversarial training;conditional generation adversarial network;conditional generative adversarial networks;deep learning-based recurrent neural networks variants;hydrological information;mine water level time series information;water levels;water resources scheduling;watershed multipoint water level prediction;WLP-ForGAN model;WLP-ForGAN network structure","","","","18","IEEE","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Graph neural networks have a strong ability to capture the spatial topology characteristics and may be combined with recurrent neural networks or dilated convolution methods in time series prediction, producing a large number of spatiotemporal graph convolution models. Such models have been widely and successfully applied in traffic forecasting. Differing from urban traffic flow data, the statistical time span of port vessel flow and throughput data is large, its spatial span is wide, and the data experience significant fluctuations. Consequently, certain spatiotemporal graph convolution traffic prediction models are unsuitable for shipping scenarios. To address this shortcoming, we have created a unique port flow dataset based on automatic identification system (AIS) and port geographic data. Using theoretical analysis and experimental comparison, we have determined the most appropriate model for shipping predictions based on existing spatiotemporal graph models and have proposed model optimization recommendations for the maritime domain. Our experiment based on an open source traffic forecasting framework to compare the results of multiple existing spatiotemporal graph models under fair conditions with the central ports of Rotterdam, Shanghai, Boston, and Singapore.

In order to get a more accurate forecasting result, variational mode decomposition (VMD) with sample entropy (SE) is developed to decompose the original PV power and decide which model is used to predict for the decomposed sub-series.

However, the existing Short-term Load Forecasting Models (SLFMs) generally consider the temporal dependency as static. Meanwhile, the load characteristics of periodic soft alignment and planed are ignored. Those neglect limits the STLF accuracy. In this paper, a Transformer based Short-term Load Forecasting Model (TSLFM) considering dynamic temporal dependency, periodic soft alignment and future information was proposed. Based on the encoder-decoder structure, TSLFM can be easily modified to satisfy different forecast ranges. Besides, the attention mechanism is employed in Transformer, TSLFM can capture the dynamic temporal dependency and realize periodic soft alignment. Additionally, TSLFM expands the attention range to combine historical and future information to infer the planed load. The results from two empirical studies in Switzerland and China suggest that: 1) TSLFM has good forecast performance (the maximum improvement of MAPE is 15.78% and 14.07%, and the minimum improvement is 8.49%, 8.99%, respectively) and can satisfy the high requirements for STLF, and 2) the attention maps further verify that TSLFM can consider dynamic temporal dependency, periodic soft alignment and future information.","","978-1-6654-8957-7","10.1109/SPIES55999.2022.10082249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10082249","Short-term load forecasting;Transformer;attention mechanism;dynamic temporal dependency;periodic soft alignment","Load forecasting;Biological system modeling;Energy;Power system dynamics;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Transformers","load forecasting;neural nets;power engineering computing;power system economics;power system security","attention mechanism;China;dynamic temporal dependency;encoder-decoder structure;load characteristics;MAPE;operational security;periodic soft alignment;STLF;Switzerland;transformer based method;transformer based short-term load forecasting model;TSLFM","","","","15","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite extensive research on the subject, RE generation forecasting still remains a challenge, and research is ongoing to achieve a near-perfect and efficient prediction. Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms have performed efficiently in areas like speech recognition, image classification, as well as forecasting tasks, such as economic time series, but have been sparsely applied in renewable energy power forecasting.

However, does this mean that PTLMs know sequence analysis? This paper explores whether BERT pre-trained on a large amount of data contains knowledge of sequence analysis. Specifically, we adopt prompt learning to see whether BERT will achieve good results on cloud-edge time series forecasting and sentiment analysis tasks. For the cloud-edge time series forecasting task, we give BERT some regular cloud-edge data and let it predict the features of the next time step; For the sentiment analysis task, we give BERT some sentence with sentiment and ask it what sentiment these sen-tences carry. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) BERT performs not well on the cloud-edge time series forecasting task, which means the logical reasoning of BERT is not good; (2) for sentiment analysis task, BERT with the prompt template performs poorly on both English and Chinese datasets; and (3) for sentiment analysis task, BERT appears to be more likely to perceive the text as carrying positive sentiment.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00051","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802316,61872298,61902324); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074780","pre-trained language models;BERT;time series forecasting;sentiment analysis;prompt learning","Sentiment analysis;Sequences;Fault detection;Bit error rate;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Cognition","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;sentiment analysis;text analysis;time series","BERT performs;cloud-edge time series forecasting task;existing pre-trained language models;natural language processing tasks;prompt learning;PTLMs;regular cloud-edge data;sentiment analysis task;sequence analysis","","","","33","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with this problem, a Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Convolution neural network based on Long Term Memory is proposed (DHGCN-LSTM). Firstly, several Spatial-temporal heterogeneous graphs are constructed based on the procurement and sales links in the multi-value chain. Secondly, the heterogeneous graphs of time series sales are input into GCN to extract the spatial features of multiple value chains. Next, the output results of GCN are aggregated and compressed into a 2-dimensional matrix. Finally, a 2-dimensional matrix is used as the input of LSTM to obtain the output prediction results. Experimental results show that the root RMSE of the prediction accuracy of the DHGCN-LSTM model is improved by about 10% compared with XXX, which can provide parts procurement and intelligent forecasting service for the Auto parts procurement department in practical application.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074708","Heterogeneous Dynamic Graph;Multi-value chain;Graph convolutional neural network;Long-Short Term Memory;Auto parts prediction","Procurement;Convolution;Time series analysis;Supply chains;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Data mining","automotive components;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;graph neural networks;procurement;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;sales management;supply chain management;time series","2-dimensional matrix;autoparts procurement department;cross-chain procurement allocation;DHGCN-LSTM;dynamic heterogeneous graph convolution neural network;GCN;global supply chain;joint procurement decisions;long short-term memory;multiple value chain flow;multivalue chain auto parts demand prediction;multivalue chain flow;single-point management;spatial feature extraction;spatial-temporal heterogeneous graphs;time series sales","","","","16","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the collected data, users' power load data can be analyzed, which can efficiently allocate power resources and avoid resource waste caused by the limitation of power resource storage. However, the data collected by smart meters involves a large amount of users' private information.

Several recent research studies have demonstrated the value of accurate prediction as a motivator for investors, researchers, and market analysts, regardless of market trend. Traditional approaches such as Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have produced results that are inefficient and inaccurate, leading to the development of Deep Learning-based solutions (DL). With the increased use of DL techniques in prediction, its performance is showing significant improvements over traditional time series models. With their ability to learn patterns and predict future prices, DL models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are becoming increasingly popular. Even so, these models continue to evolve and are continually revised to make them more efficient and better. To forecast the price for the 11th day, we present an RNN-GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model based on four independent features and the prices from the previous ten days. Furthermore, this model's performance was compared to that of an LSTM and CNN model.

Existing traffic flow forecast approaches rely on shallow learning models, which are unsatisfactory for many real-world applications. This situation prompts us to reconsider traffic flow prediction using deep learning models and large amounts of traffic data. In this paper, we present the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE), and an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, all of which are deep learning methods.

On account of these highlights, monetary information should have a fierce design that frequently makes it hard to track down dependable models. The stock expectation has been a peculiarity since AI was presented. Stock costs are not haphazardly produced values rather they can be treated as a discrete-time series model which depends on a bunch of obvious mathematical information things gathered at progressive focuses at ordinary time frames. However, not many methods became valuable for anticipating the stock cost as it changes with time. Since it is fundamental to distinguish a model to examine patterns of stock costs with sufficient data for navigation, it suggests that changing the time series utilizing ARIMA is a preferred algorithmic methodology over determining straightforwardly, as it gives more genuine and solid outcomes.

At this time, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has proven to be a possible hazard to human life. The ARIMA Model i.e., Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average is compared with Facebook’s Prophet and VARMAX model to foretell the future. The dataset is divided into the training and testing set. The size of the COVID-19 dataset is relatively small as it is a pandemic that occurred recently, due to which much of the data is used for training purposes and the last twelve days have been used for testing and validating the model. The model is trained and fits on the training data set. The algorithms are now ready to anticipate future forecasts after it has been tested and trained. The models also record the predicted and actual values, allowing them to improve their accuracy in the future.
