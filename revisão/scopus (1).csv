Online fluorimeters were installed on the raw water intake at four groundwater-derived UK public water supplies alongside existing turbidity sensors that are used to forewarn of the presence of microbial contamination in the water industry. The fluorimeters targeted fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM) peaks at excitation/emission wavelengths of 280/365 nm (tryptophan-like fluorescence, TLF) and 280/450 nm (humic-like fluorescence, HLF). Discrete samples were collected for Escherichia coli, total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry, and laboratory-based fluorescence and absorbance. Both TLF and HLF were strongly correlated with E. coli (ρ = 0.71–0.77) and total bacterial cell concentrations (ρ = 0.73–0.76), whereas the correlations between turbidity and E. coli (ρ = 0.48) and total bacterial cell counts (ρ = 0.40) were much weaker. No clear TLF peak was observed at the sites and all apparent TLF was considered to be optical bleed-through from the neighbouring HLF peak. Therefore, a HLF fluorimeter alone would be sufficient to evaluate the microbial water quality at these sources. Fluorescent DOM was also influenced by site operations such as pump start-up and the precipitation of cations on the sensor windows. Online fluorescent DOM sensors are a better indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water than turbidity and they have wide-ranging potential applications within the water industry. © 2018 British Geological Survey, a component institute of NERC - ‘BGS © NERC 2018’","Bacteria enumeration; Drinking water; Faecal contamination; Flow cytometry; Online fluorescence spectroscopy; Turbidity","Drinking Water; England; Escherichia coli; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescence; Groundwater; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Tryptophan; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply; United Kingdom; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Amino acids; Cells; Escherichia coli; Flow cytometry; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Potable water; Quality control; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; cation; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; ground water; drinking water; tryptophan; Bacteria enumeration; Bacterial cells; Cell count; Dissolved organic matters; E. coli; Fecal contamination; Microbial quality; Online fluorescence spectroscopy; Real time evaluation; Water industries; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; fecal coliform; flow cytometry; fluorescence spectroscopy; microbial activity; real time; turbidity; water industry; water quality; water supply; aquifer; Article; bacterial cell; bacterial count; Escherichia coli; flow cytometry; fluorescence spectroscopy; humic substance; nonhuman; online analysis; priority journal; time series analysis; turbidity; water quality; water supply; chemistry; England; fluorescence; microbiology; procedures; spectrofluorometry; water quality; Fluorescence","","tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; Drinking Water, ; Tryptophan, ","","","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/M021939/1); Department for International Development, UK Government, DFID, (AQ140023); Royal Society; National Eye Research Centre, NERC","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to Peter Williams and Barry Townsend who undertook sample analysis and collection, respectively.

Current DFMs usually require panels with a minimum of 20 years of quarterly data (80 time observations per panel). In contrast, the application we consider includes panels with a median of 8 annual observations. As a result, the time dimension in our paper is substantially shorter than previous work in the DFM literature. This difference increases the computational challenges of the estimation process which we address by developing the “Two-Cycle Conditional Expectation - Maximization” (2CCEM) algorithm which is a variant of the EM algorithm and its extensions. We analyze the conditions under which our model is identified and provide simulation results demonstrating consistency of our 2CCEM estimator. We apply the DFM to a dataset of 802 water and sanitation utilities from 43 countries and use the 2CCEM algorithm in order to estimate dynamic performance trajectories for each utility. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Dynamic factor models; EM algorithm; Panel data; State-space models; Water utilities","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (AG13846)","The authors would like to thank Alexander Danilenko for providing data from the International Benchmarking Network.

Measures affected both economic activities and citizens' behaviors as they developed more intense hygiene habits to avoid contamination and switched to home offices. These exceptional behaviors also affected the way that water is consumed and need to be fully understood to manage supply systems. Therefore, this study aims to investigate changes in residential and commercial water consumption in 31 municipalities in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, during SARS-CoV-2. To do this, the expected consumption for the first half of 2020 was forecasted using the Holt-Winters multiplicative method and compared with the data observed for the same period. In addition, we compared monthly records of new contaminations and the social distancing index to establish a correlation with changes in water consumption. The results show an average difference between forecasted and observed consumption equal to +6.23% and -18.59% for residential and commercial activities, respectively. For the first one, the consumption per capita increased at the rate of 8.44 L.person-1.day-1. The observed changes in consumption seem to be a consequence of hygiene habits, social distancing and the closing of nonessential services in commerce.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","COVID-19; Drink water; Forecast; Holt-Winters; Urban water consumption; Water security","Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Behavioral research; Economics; Housing; Drink water; Economic activities; Forecast; Holt-Winters; Human behaviors; Sao Paulo; Urban water consumption; Urban waters; Water consumption; Water security; assessment method; COVID-19; drinking water; forecasting method; hygiene; water supply; water use; Coronavirus; COVID-19","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Universidade de São Paulo, USP; Pro-Reitoria de Pesquisa, Universidade de São Paulo","The authors would like to thank the Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo (Sabesp) for providing the database.

The results also suggest that such a re-engineered infrastructure might even enable the city to act as a force for good in its environment. Assessing the sustainability of these prospective engineering transitions depends not only upon matters such as the urban ecological footprint, but more centrally on the concept of a system's spectrum of environmental perturbations and on computation of this spectrumfor pre- and post-city states. This paper begins by discussing the core concept of the city as a force for good (CFG) and defining the attributes and vital role of the unfamiliar measure of 'spectrum'. Continuing with the case study of the Atlanta-Chattahoochee city-catchment system, an improved assembly of simulation sub-models was constructed in order to accommodate a change in climate, specified essentially as the difference between a 20-year average of annual precipitation variations across the Chattahoochee catchment for the years 1974-1993 (observed past) and 2020-2039 (forecast future). The outcome of this test is that the sustainability of previously preferred strategies for re-engineering of city wastewater infrastructure in pursuit of CFG is climate-insensitive (i.e. robust under climate change). However, climate change as such has been narrowly and rudimentarily articulated. The paper touches upon assessments geared to the behaviour of the city-catchment system at the margins (extremes) and looks forward to extensive subsequent studies designed to explore these matters much more fully.","Sustainability; Urban regeneration; Water supply","Catchments; Climate models; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Reengineering; Runoff; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Wastewater; Water supply; Water supply systems; Annual precipitation; Aquatic ecosystem; Atlanta; Catchment system; Ecological footprint; Environmental perturbations; Georgia; Simulation studies; Submodels; Sustainability; Urban regeneration; Wastewater infrastructure; Water infrastructure; Climate change","","","","","","","Achleitner S., Moderl M., Rauch W., Urine separation as part of a real-time control strategy, Urban Water Journal, 4, 4, pp. 233-240, (2007); Acreman M., Aldrick J., Binnie C., Et al., Environmental flows from dams: The water framework directive, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Engineering Sustainability, 162, 1, pp. 13-22, (2009); Amin M., Toward self-healing energy infrastructure systems, IEEE Computer Applications in Power, 14, 1, pp. 20-28, (2001); Arthington A.H., Bunn S.E., Poff N.L., Naiman R.J., The challenge of providing environmental flow rules to sustain river ecosystems, Ecological Applications, 16, 4, pp. 1311-1318, (2006); Ashley R., Blackwood D., Butler D., Et al., Making asset investment decisions for wastewater systems that include sustainability, Journal of Environmental Engineering, 134, 3, pp. 200-209, (2008); Bai X., Industrial ecology and the global impacts of cities, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11, 2, pp. 1-6, (2007); Barles S., Feeding the city: Food consumption and flow of nitrogen, Paris, 1801-1914, Science of the Total Environment, 375, 1-3, pp. 48-58, (2007); Beck M.B., Operational Water Quality Management: Beyond Planning and Design, (1981); Beck M.B., Transient pollution events: Acute risks to the aquatic environment, Water Science and Technology, 33, 2, pp. 1-15, (1996); Environmental Foresight and Models: A Manifesto, (2002); Beck M.B., Vulnerability of water quality in intensively developing catchments, Environmental Modelling and Software, 20, 4, pp. 381-400, (2005); Beck M.B., Forward in the Face of Vagueness: Sustainability in the Urban Water Sector, (2008); Beck M.B., Fath B.D., Parker A.K., Et al., Developing a concept of adaptive community learning: Case study of a rapidly urbanizing catchment, Integrated Assessment, 3, 4, pp. 299-307, (2002); Beck M.B., Gupta H., Rastetter E., Et al., Grand Challenges of the Future for Environmental Modeling, (2009); Beck M.B., Jiang F., Shi F., Villarroel Walker R., Technology, sustainability, and business: Cities as forces for good in the environment, Integrated Urban Water Management in Temperate Climates, 2010; Bicknell B.R., Imhoff J.C., Kittle J.L., Donigian A.S., Johanson R.C., Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran, User's Manual for Version 11, (1997); Borenstein S., Obama looking at cooling air to fight warming, The Associated Press, (2009); Boulanger P-M., Sustainable development indicators: A scientific challenge, a democratic issue, Surveys and Perspectives Integrating Environment and Society, 1, 1, pp. 59-73, (2008); Burkholder J., Eggleston D., Glasgow H., Et al., Comparative impacts of two major hurricane seasons on the Neuse River and Western Pamlico Sound ecosystems, Proceedings National Academy of Sciences, 101, 25, pp. 9291-9296, (2004); Capon A.G., Hanna E.G., Climate change: An emerging health issue, New South Wales Public Health Bulletin, 20, 1-2, pp. 1-4, (2009); Capon A.G., Synnott E.S., Holliday S., Urbanism, climate change and health: Systems approaches to governance, New South Wales Public Health Bulletin, 20, 1-2, pp. 24-28, (2009); Coglianese C., Is satisfaction success?

The pressing need to examine this relationship further is highlighted by the rapid decline in quantity and degradation of water quality around us every day, especially in developing countries. Simple criterions of water supply and pollution are fall short of the requirement of integrated water resources management. The Human-Water Harmony Index (HWHI) method is based on the concept of harmony and offers a more holistic approach. The index employs 27 indicators from three dimensions (development, coordination, and satisfaction) and was applied to five important cities in China- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an and Nanjing. The results show they are confronted with the disharmony in human-water relationship of varying degrees, and the weaknesses of each city are of distinctly different types according to the dimension scores. The framework provides a common language based on systems thinking, the introduction of subjective indicator surveys, as well as separated evaluation of development and coordination degrees of the human-water system. The HWHI make it possible to point out the weak factors, prioritize the needs for investment, so as to improve the water-related strategies and policies to help built a harmonious human-water relationship. This approach has the potential for application in other areas and scales for monitoring and comparison purposes, and allows for comparison over time. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Assessment; China; Harmony; Human-water relationship; Index","Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shanghai; Developing countries; Population statistics; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply; Assessment; China; Harmony; Human-water relationship; Index; comparative study; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; index method; integrated approach; nature-society relations; population growth; socioeconomic impact; water management; water pollution; water supply; Water pollution","","","","","National Science and Technology Planning Project, (51279047); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (50925932); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, (IRT1233)","Acknowledgments This article is funded by the National Science and Technology Support Program of China (NO. 51279047), National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (NO. 50925932), and Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(IRT1233).

University of Bio-Bio, Chile","Domestic hot water (DHW) consumption in dwellings can play a key role in the development of policies that are focused on energy poverty, and in improving energy efficiency, among other aspects. There is an important variability observed with DHW among different countries due to technical, sociological, climatic, and economic factors. Most studies that deal with DHW predictions are based on stochastic models, and only a few apply time series or statistical methods. In the case of Chile, the country is undergoing a policy development process, and there is little information about DHW consumption. As a result, it is fundamental to have DHW consumption prediction models that are focused on dwelling. For this reason, the study analysed the possibility of using time series models to make future estimations about monthly domestic hot water (DHW) consumption. To this end, consumption data obtained from 98 apartments between 2015 and 2021 were used, and 3 approaches were applied namely, exponential smoothing, basic structural model (BSM), and state-space model (SSM). The results showed that exponential smoothing and state-space methods allowed to obtain satisfactory results with regard to percentage error and confidence levels. Therefore, these models could be used to make future estimations of domestic hot water (DHW) consumption. © 2022","Domestic hot water (DHW); Energy poverty; Prediction; Social housing; Time series","Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; State space methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Water; Domestic hot water; Energy poverties; Exponential smoothing; Prediction modelling; Social housing; Sociological factor; Technical factors; Times series; Water consumption predictions; Forecasting","","","","","ANID; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (1200551); national agency for research and development","The authors would like to acknowledge that this paper is part of the project, “Fondecyt Regular 1200551 - Energy poverty prediction based on social housing architectural design in the central and central-southern zones of Chile: an innovative index to analyse and reduce the risk of energy poverty,” funded by the national agency for research and development (ANID) .

Model identification was done by visual inspection on the Autocorrelation Function(ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function(PACF). The model parameters were computed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. In model verification, the chosen criterion for model parsimony was the Akaike Information Criteria Corrected(AICC) and the diagnostic checks include residuals' independence, homoscedasticity and normal distribution. The best ARIMA models for the Dengkil, Kg. Lui and Kg. Rinching series were (1,1,0), (1,1,0) and (1,1,1) respectively, with their AICC values of 133.736, 55.348 and 42.292. Homoscedasticity was confirmed with the Breusch-Pagan test giving p-values of 0.145, 0.195 and 0.747 for the Dengkil, Kg. Lui and Kg. Rinching models respectively. Forecast series up to a lead time of eight years were generated using the accepted ARIMA models. Model accuracy was checked by comparing the synthetic series with the original series. Results show that the ARIMA models for the rivers and the forecast series were adequate. In conclusion, the Box-Jenkins approach to ARIMA modelling was found to be appropriate and adequate for the rivers. The flood forecast up to a lead time of eight years for the three models exhibit a straight line with near constant streamflow values showing that the forecast values were similar to the last recorded observation. © 2016, Int.

A major gap in NDMA research is an understanding of the persistence of wastewater-derived precursors within the natural environment. This research sought to fill this knowledge gap by surveying NDMA precursors across the length of a wastewater effluent-dominated wash. Significant precursor reduction (17%) was found to occur from introduction into the wash to a point 9 h downstream. This reduction translates into a half-life of roughly 32 h for bulk NDMA precursors. Further laboratory experiments examining rates of photolysis, biodegradation and loss to sediments, illustrated that both photolytic and biological degradation were effective removal mechanisms for NDMA precursors. Loss to sediments that were acquired from the wash did not appear to reduce NDMA precursors in the water column, although a control conducted with DI water provided evidence that significant NDMA precursors could be released from autoclaved sediments (suggesting that sorption does occur). Microbial experiments revealed that microbes associated with sediments were much more effective at degrading precursors than microbes within the water column. Overall, this study demonstrated that natural processes are capable of attenuating NDMA precursors relatively quickly within the environment, and that utilities might benefit from maximizing source water residency time in the environment, prior to introduction into treatment plants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodegradation; Disinfection by-products; N-Nitrosodimethylamine; Photolysis; Sorption","Biodegradation, Environmental; Cities; Dimethylnitrosamine; Environmental Monitoring; Half-Life; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Byproducts; Disinfection; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Natural attenuation; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Potable water; Sediments; Sorption; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water; Water treatment; dimethylnitrosamine; drinking water; waste water; water pollutant; Biological degradation; Disinfection by-product; Disinfection byproducts; Laboratory experiments; N-nitrosodimethylamine; Natural environments; Treated wastewater; Wastewater effluents; biodegradation; disinfection; drinking water; photolysis; sorption; waste facility; wastewater; water treatment; Article; biodegradation; microcosm; photolysis; priority journal; sea level; sediment; time series analysis; waste water; analysis; bioremediation; city; environmental monitoring; half life time; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Effluents","","dimethylnitrosamine, 62-75-9; Dimethylnitrosamine, ; Waste Water, ; Water Pollutants, Chemical, ","","","","","Buckingham S.E., Whitney J.W., GIS methodology for quantifying channel change in Las Vegas, Nevada, J.

Future prediction of water quality parameters is necessary for the planning of water quality management. Sodium adsorption rate (SAR) is a parameter, which has a significant role in irrigation. In the present study, we compared the forecasting of SAR of water in Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, Iran, using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series and radial basis functions (RBF) neural network. We found ARIMA (0,1,1) × (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1), and ARIMA (0,1,2) × (1,1,1)12 with minimum Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) of –1.7127, –1.8177, 2.9317, and 12.44 for SAR prediction of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, respectively. The residual of the mentioned ARIMA models was independent (p-value > 0.05). Using RBF neural network for SAR forecasting of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers with normalized data, we obtained proper training and testing. Mean squared error (MSE are between 0.00026 and 0.0255) and mean bias error (MBE are between 0.01566 and 0.0612) for training is very low. Likewise, coefficient of determination (R2 are between 0.907 and 0.960), index of agreement (IA are between 0.981 and 0.999), and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (E are between 0.964 and 0.999) approach to 1, which describes the reliability of the model’s performance. Thirty-six months RBF neural network and 12 months of ARIMA time series of SAR forecasting for Aras River comparatively match to the measured data and forecast error of both RBF and ARIMA were comparable. We compared forecast errors of the ARIMA time series and RBF neural network for SAR forecasting of Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers; the results presented that RBF neural network is more reliable than ARIMA for the predicting of SAR. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

Urban water planners need to balance increasing water demand with water resources that are under increasing pressure due to climate change and water pollution. Decision makers are forced to select the most appropriate water management alternative with respect to multiple, conflicting criteria based on short and long term projections of water demand in the future. In this paper, we consider water management in Istanbul, a megacity with a population of 15 million. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a method combining demand forecasting with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to evaluate five different water supply alternatives with respect to seven criteria using opinions of experts and stakeholders from different sectors. Methodology: To combine forecasting with MCDM, we design a data collection method in which we share our demand forecasts with our experts. For demand forecasting, we compare Holt-Winters, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (S-ARIMA), and feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models and select S-ARIMA as the best forecasting model for monthly water consumption data. Generated demand projections are shared with experts from different sectors and collected data is evaluated with Fuzzy Theory using two distinct MCDM models: Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE). Also our analyses are complemented with two sensitivity analyses. Findings: Our results indicate that greywater reuse is the best alternative to satisfy the growing water demand of the city whereas all experts find desalination and inter-basin water transfer as the least attractive solutions. In addition, we adopt the PROMETHEE GDSS procedure to obtain a GAIA plane indicating consensus among experts. Furthermore, we find that our results are moderately sensitive to the number of experts and they are insensitive to changes in experts’ evaluations. Novelty: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one incorporating water demand and supply management concepts into the evaluation of alternatives. From a methodological perspective, water demand projections have never been used in an MCDM study in the literature. Also, this paper contributes to the literature with a mathematical construction of consensus and Monte Carlo simulations for the sufficiency of experts consulted in a study. © 2020","Demand forecasting; Multi criteria decision making; Water management","Autoregressive moving average model; Climate change; Decision making; Desalination; Economic and social effects; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Monte Carlo methods; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Inter-basin water transfer; Mathematical constructions; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Water demand and supply; Water demand projections; Water pollution","","","","","Istanbul University Research Fund; TÜBİTAK; British Association for Psychopharmacology, BAP, (MAB-2019-34967); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK, (118M477)","The study is funded partly by the Istanbul University Research Fund (BAP), Turkey through the project MAB-2019-34967 and partly by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) with a grant number 118M477 .

The primary emphasis of this work is the development of a contamination mitigation control scheme. A leak typically leads to a drop in network pressure that increases the risk of contamination. A leakage localization algorithm is responsible for detecting and localizing the leakage in the WDN. When a leak is detected in the network the contamination mitigation control is activated. The flow and pressure settings of the pumps are regulated by the contamination mitigation control in an optimal manner to minimize the risk of contamination. The entire framework is tested on the Smart Water Infrastructure Laboratory situated at Aalborg University, Denmark and a large-scale benchmark water network, which is part of a city network, L-town. © 2023 The Authors","Contamination mitigation control; Graph theory; Leakage diagnosis; Water contamination; Water distribution networks","Contamination; Water distribution systems; Water pollution; Contamination mitigation control; Control framework; Control schemes; In networks; Leakage diagnosis; Leakage localization; Operational management; Risk of contamination; Water contamination; Water distribution networks; Graph theory","","","","","Poul Due Jensens Fond","This work was supported by Poul Due Jensen Foundation, Denmark .

Particularly, socioeconomic evaluation for different regions is crucial before implementing water resources management policies. To address this issue, 14 countries in the world that have continuous increasing trends of using renewable water per capita (RWPC) during 1998-2017 were used for the estimation of eight socioeconomic parameters associated with four key indicators (i.e., economy, demographics, technology communication, and health sanitation) by using four different data-driven methods, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), gene expression programming (GEP), and wavelet-gene expression programming (WGEP). The performances of the models were evaluated by using correlation coefficient (R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). It was found that the WGEP model had the best performance in estimating all parameters. The mathematical expressions for these socioeconomic parameters were explored and their potential to be expanded in different spatial and temporal dimensions was assessed. The derived equations provide a quantitative means for the future estimation of the socioeconomic parameters in the studied countries. © 2023 The Authors.","artificial neural networks; data-driven modeling; renewable water resources; socioeconomic parameters; water availability; wavelet-GEP models","Gene expression; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Support vector machines; Water resources; Data-driven methods; Data-driven model; Gene-expression programming; Programming models; Renewable water resource; Socio-economics; Socioeconomic parameter; Water availability; Waters resources; Wavelet-gene expression programming model; advanced technology; artificial neural network; gene expression; prediction; water availability; water resource; Neural networks","","","","","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF","The authors thank Iran’s National Science Foundation (INSF) for its financial support for this research.","Aerts J.

This study is aimed at investigating the epidemiology and risk factors of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (pinkeye) in Huangshi Port District of Huangshi City. Methods. A total of 593 cases of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis from January 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the observation group. The epidemiological characteristics (age of onset, season, occupation, clinical manifestations, and etiological characteristics) were analyzed. A total of 425 healthy subjects (nonacute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis) were selected as the control group. The general data of the two groups were compared, and the risk factors affecting the occurrence of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis were analyzed by logistic regression. Results. The onset age of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was mainly concentrated in 0-20-year-old and 60-year-old age groups, and the onset season was mainly concentrated in April to August, with the highest incidence in May. The proportions of middle school students and workers in patients with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis were higher than those of other occupations (both P<0.05). Ocular conjunctival congestion, tingling, and foreign body sensation were the main clinical manifestations of patients with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Among the 593 conjunctival swab samples collected in this study, the positive rates of HEV70 and CVA24v were higher than those of adenovirus nucleic acid (both P<0.05). The proportion of people aged ≤40 years old, male, working outdoors, using potable water equipment, contact history of patients with acute conjunctivitis, history of chemical substances entering eyes, combined with immune system diseases, and public toilet utilization rate≥1 times/d in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (all P<0.05), and the proportion of people washing hands before eating and after toilet was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that working place outdoors, use of potable water equipment, contact history of patients with acute conjunctivitis (all P<0.05), and use of public toilets≥once a day were risk factors for the occurrence of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and washing hands before eating and after toilet was a protective factor (P<0.05). Conclusion. The onset age of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was mainly concentrated in 0-20-year-old and 60-year-old age; the onset season was mainly concentrated in summer and autumn; adenovirus is the main pathogenic bacteria; ocular conjunctivitis congestion, tingling, and foreign body sensation were the main clinical manifestations; working place outdoors, use of potable water equipment, contact history of patients with acute conjunctivitis (all P<0.05), and use of public toilets≥once a day were risk factors for the occurrence of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, while washing hands before eating and after toilet was a protective factor.  © 2022 Juan Liu and Hui Zhang.","","Adolescent;

This paper describes the events that prompted this reduction. We look at how changes in water use were affected by official announcements and by public engagement with this news via the social media activity and internet searches. We analysed the water usage of a subset of middle to high income households where smart hot and cold water meters were installed. For hot water usage patterns we compared meter readings with that in another area unaffected by the drought. We further map our cold water smart meter readings against that of the City of Cape Town's municipal data for domestic freestanding households — a sample of more than 400,000 households. We found that the introduction of Level 5 restrictions had a perverse effect on consumption, possibly due to confusing messages. The most dramatic change in behaviour appears to have been instigated by a media storm and consequent user panic after the release of the City's Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan in October 2017. However, contradictory communication from national and provincial government eroded some of this gain. The paper concludes with recommendations for demand management in a similar future scenario. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cape town drought; Demand side management; Drought response; Household water usage; Smart water meters; Time-of-day analysis; User behaviour","Cities; Droughts; South Africa; Water; Water Supply; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape; Behavioral research; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Search engines; Smart meters; Taps; Water supply; hot water; tap water; water; Cape Town; Cape town drought; Drought response; Household water; Household water usage; Smart water meter; Time of day; Time-of-day analyse; User behaviors; Water usage; behavioral response; cold water; demand-side management; drought; equipment; governance approach; household income; local participation; social media; temporal analysis; water planning; water use; Article; behavior change; case study; city; controlled study; descriptive research; drought; highest income group; household; human; Internet; priority journal; social media; temporal analysis; water deprivation; city; South Africa; water supply; Drought","","water, 7732-18-5; Water, ","","","MTN, (S003061); Water Research Commission, WRC, (K1-7163)","Thinus Booysen thanks MTN South Africa for financial and technical support, through grant S003061 ; the Water Research Commission for funding the Geasy project through grant K1-7163 ; TalkWalker for access to their social media analysis application; and Bridgiot for access to their smart meter data.

This study promotes an objective-based multi-attributes decision-making framework that takes into account the uncertainties associated with the impacts of the climate change on water resources systems. To capture the uncertainties of climate change, Monte Carlo approach has been used to generate a series of ensembles. These generated ensembles represent the stochastic behavior of the hydro-climatic variables under climate change. This framework represents the inherent uncertainties associated with hydro-climatic simulations. Next, a coupled TOPSIS/Entropy multi-attribute decision-making framework has been formed to prioritize the feasible alternatives using system performance measures. The main objective of this framework is to minimize the risk of deceptive and subjective assessments during decision-making process. Karkheh River basin has been selected as a case study to demonstrate the implication of this framework. Using a set of system performance attributes, the performance of two hydropower systems has been estimated during the baseline period and under the future climate change conditions. According to the conducted frequency analysis, the alternative in which both hydropower projects would go under construction emerged as the robust solution (i.e., there was a 99.9% chance that it outperforms other solutions). The results indicate that the construction of these hydropower systems leads to the increase of Karkheh River basin robustness in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Entropy; Hydropower systems; Monte Carlo simulation; Multi-attribute decision-making; Robustness; TOPSIS; Uncertainty","Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan; Decision making; Decision theory; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Stochastic systems; Water resources; Watersheds; Decision making process; Multi attribute decision making; Multi-attributes decision makings; Potential fluctuations; Subjective assessments; Surrounding environment; System performance measures; Water resources systems; climate change; decision making; design; entropy; hydroelectric power plant; performance assessment; uncertainty analysis; water planning; Climate change","","","","","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF","The authors thank Iran’s National Science Foundation (INSF).

However, limited data often restrain the development of a robust groundwater model. This study presents a methodology to develop groundwater vulnerability zones in a data-scarce area. The Head-Guided Zonation (HGZ) method was applied on the recharge area of Oemau Spring in Rote Island, Indonesia, which is under potential risk of contamination from rapid land use changes. In this method the model domain is divided into zones of piecewise constant into which the values of subsurface properties are assigned in the parameterisation step. Using reverse particle-tracking simulation on the calibrated and validated groundwater model, the simulation results (travel time and pathline trajectory) were combined with the potential groundwater contamination risk from human activities (land use type and current practice) to develop three vulnerability zones. The corresponding preventive management strategies were proposed to protect the spring from contamination and to ensure provision of safe and good quality water from the spring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eogenetic karst aquifer; Groundwater contamination; Model calibration; Particle tracking; Vulnerability zones","Groundwater; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Water Pollutants; Indonesia; Aquifers; Contamination; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Land use; Tracking (position); Travel time; ground water; water pollutant; Eogenetic karsts; Groundwater contamination; Groundwater modeling; Groundwater vulnerability; Management strategies; Model calibration; Particle tracking; Subsurface properties; human activity; hydrological modeling; karst; parameterization; simulation; vulnerability; water pollution; water quality; zonation; aquifer; Article; calibration; grid cell; human activities; hydraulic conductivity; land use; natural spring; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; water analysis; water contamination; water quality; water retention; water table; zonation; human; particle size; theoretical model; water pollutant; Groundwater pollution","","Water Pollutants, ","","","","","Abusaada M., Sauter M., Studying the flow dynamics of a karst aquifer system with an equivalent porous medium model, Groundwater, 51, 4, pp. 641-650, (2013); Allen R.G., Pereira L.S., Raes D., Smith M., Crop Evapotranspiration - Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, pp. 1-333, (1998); Aller L., Lehr J.H., Petty R., Bennet T., DRASTIC: a Standardised System for Evaluating Groundwater Pollution Potentials Using Hydrogeological Settings, pp. 38-57, (1987); Atkinson S.F., Johnson D.R., Venables B.J., Slye J.L., Kennedy J.R., Dyer S.D., Price B.B., Ciarlo M., Stanton K., Sanderson H., Nielsen A., Use of watershed factors to predict consumer surfactant risk, water quality, and habitat quality in the upper Trinity River, Texas, Sci.

In this research, we took the Miyun reservoir watershed as a typical area, of which a material flow model of the N metabolism was built. Afterwards, the material flow analysis (MFA) was conducted to identify the main pathways that generated N loading. And then the Monte Carlo (MC) method was applied to make uncertainty analysis of the N loading calculated through the MFA. The MFA results showed that the total N loading to surface water of the Miyun reservoir watershed was 5505.42 × 103 kg N, of which about 74.89% was originated from the agriculture subsystem (i.e., crop planting, fruit planting and vegetable planting subsystems). The main pathways of the agriculture subsystem that generated N loading were recognized as maize, chestnut, apple, pear, cabbage, cucumber and tomato planting. The uncertainty analysis results revealed that the N loading calculated from the MFA had some uncertainty, of which the fruit planting and industry subsystem had the biggest uncertainty, while the N loading from the fish farming subsystem had the lowest uncertainty. To make directed actions to protect the water quality of the Miyun reservoir watershed, the main pathways of each subsystem that generated N loading need to be regulated. This study provided a new framework of combing the MFA and MC method to simulate N loading to surface water at watershed scale, and was of vital significance to provide decision support for the watershed N pollution management globally. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Material flow analysis; Miyun reservoir; Monte Carlo simulation; Nitrogen non-point source pollution; Uncertainty analysis; Watershed management","Decision support systems; Fruits; Intelligent systems; Loading; Nitrogen; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Soil conservation; Surface waters; Uncertainty analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Materials flow analysis; Miyun Reservoir; Monte Carlo's simulation; MonteCarlo methods; N pollutions; Nitrogen non-point source pollution; Nonpoint-source pollution (NPS); Plantings; Uncertainty; Watersheds management; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","Hubei Provincial Department of Water Resources, (HBSLKY202124); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52000120, U20A20117); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B1111380003)","This research was supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province ( 2020B1111380003 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U20A20117 and No. 52000120 ), and the Key Science and Technology Project of Hubei Provincial Department of Water Resources ( HBSLKY202124 ).

Therefore, “Non-Revenue water” and supply demands are necessary to reduce the water losses and save the financial resources to strengthen the water sector. To do that we must develop the ideal water usage/loss prediction model to plan the future usage of water. This paper explores and develops AI models that could efficiently predict the water losses and water demands in Palestine, focusing mainly on Beitunia city. Different Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with different learning approaches had been used in this paper. The historical and extracted data, representing water supply/consumption in Beitunia are used to propose a nonlinear model. The data is input into the models of ANN and helps predict the water losses/demand in Palestine, to provide a more accurate prediction model. Three models of ANNs were used; Multilayer Perceptron NNs (MLPNNs) MLPNNs-LM, Radial Basis Function NNs (RBFNNs, newrb), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs-MLPNNs). We also used the Autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) as a linear statistical model to predict water supply using collected data from Beitunia city. The result showed that ANNs models are more efficient than the ARIMA model for the prediction of water movement. Finally, The MLPNNs-LM model results exceeded the other ANNs models in comparison. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

The current research develops an emerging evolutionary data-intelligence model: extreme learning machine (ELM) integrated with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to predict the performance of the Tamburawa WTP in Kano, Nigeria. A traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a classical linear autoregressive (AR) models were also employed to compare the predictive performance. For this purpose, different input data with the corresponding treated pH, turbidity, total dissolve solids, and hardness as the target variables obtained from the WTP were used. The predictive models are evaluated based on the three numerical indices, namely Nash-Sutcliffe (NC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). To examine the similarities and differences between the observed and predicted values, a two-dimension graphical diagram (i.e., Taylor diagram) was also utilized. The predictive results revealed the potential of KPCA-ELM, which exhibited a high level of accuracy in comparison to the single models for all the considered variables with a slight exception in terms of pH prediction. Two different model combination were built for each single (FFNN, ELM, and AR) model and KPCA algorithms (KPCA-FFNN, KPCA-ELM, and KPCA-AR). The results also depicted that both ELM and FFNN models demonstrated prediction skill and therefore, can serve as reliable models. The outcomes may contribute to the aforementioned modeling of the treated parameters and provides a reference benchmark for wastewater management and control in the Tamburawa WTP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-validation; Data-driven algorithms; Extreme learning marchine; Kano-Tamburawa; Principal component analysis; Water treatment plant","","","","","","Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant","The authors wish to thank the staff of the Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant, Kano (Nigeria) for supplying the available data used to conduct this research.","WHO and Unicef, Progress on sanitation and drinking water 2013 update, World Health, 1, October, pp. 1-40, (2013); Maryam B., Buyukgungor H., Wastewater reclamation and reuse trends in Turkey: opportunities and challenges, J.

As an illustration to the methodology of model fitting and synthetic data generation, a time series of monthly-maximum atmospheric temperature of district Chittaurgarh (Rajasthan, India) has been considered. With the help of methodology, a non-contiguous ARIMA model of AR (1,3,6,9,12), MA (1,3,6,9,12) has been found to represent the differenced (at lags 12) stationary series of monthly-maximum atmospheric temperature.

On the other hand, in rivers and streams, varying roughness occurs naturally but their contributions to DO availability is yet unknown. This paper examines the effects of varying roughness of different sizes and arrangement patterns on DO and also reveals how Error Correction Methodology as a modelling technique can be applied in river studies rather than using the traditional ordinary least square method with velocity (V), Froude number (Fr), roughness coefficient (K) and dispersion coefficient (d) captured as explanatory variables. The findings of this study revealed that roughness coefficient (K) had no effect on DO i.e. negative relationship with coefficient value of −0.796, with corresponding t-statistics (t = 0.615) suggesting its non-significance. In addition, Froude number (Fr) and dispersion coefficient (d) also showed negative relationships respectively (−77.71 and −2.039) with DO but with sharp significance as revealed by the corresponding t-ratio (t-ratio = −2.75 and −4.08). Thus, the study suggests that dispersion coefficient or its dimensionless number as a variable is important and should be included in the modelling, otherwise, the spread of pollutants (BOD) in the transverse and vertical directions rather than their single centre point values are essential to improve the outcome of DO and reaeration coefficient (k2) modelling. © 2018 The Author(s).

ARIMA models are used in the VTCI series, and forecast its changes in the future. A new way of modeling for the spatio-temporal series is used in the VTCI series. The time series of 36 pixels are studied firstly for their fitting models. Then the ARIMA model fitting for the whole area is determined. The AR(1) model are chosen to be the best model used in each pixel of the whole area, and the forecast is done with 1-2 steps. The results show that forecasting accuracy is better, 1 step is better than 2 steps. The historical VTCI data are simulated by AR(1) models. Comparing the simulating data with the historical data, the results show that the simulating accuracy is better. Most of the simulating errors are small. All results demonstrate that AR(1) model developed for VTCI series can be used for the drought forecasting in the Guanzhong Plain. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents two methods for predicting and forecasting the removal efficiency of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia, and sulphide at El-Berka wastewater treatment plant, Egypt. The first method uses different prediction models, includes the use of traditional feed-forward (TF), deep feed-forward backpropagation (DFB), and deep cascade-forward backpropagation (DCB) networks. The TF was generated in three layers: input, hidden, and an output layer. The DFB network comprised of six layers: an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The DCB network was created with six layers (with skip connections): an input, four hidden, and an output layer. The other method is a forecasting model by using deep learning time series forecasting (DLTSF) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The developed models were trained, validated, and tested on a real-life dataset over eight years. The results indicated that the presented models could effectively predict and forecast the future series values of the removal efficiency of the El-Berka WWTP. The DCB network achieved the highest accuracy as compared to those exhibited by the TF and DFB networks. The RMSE and R-squared for training with the DCB model are 1.95 and 0.90, respectively. The RMSE of DLTSF was 0.85 for forecasting of BOD5. Thus, the DCB and DLTSF models are recommended for evaluating and predicting the performance of WWTP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Deep learning techniques; Machine learning techniques; Wastewater treatment plant","","","","","","","","El Arabi N.E., Dawoud M.A., Groundwater aquifer recharge with treated wastewater in Egypt: technical, environmental, economical and regulatory considerations, Desalin.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Brazil; Ceara; Fortaleza; Conformal mapping; Decision trees; Developing countries; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Self organizing maps; Surveys; Water management; Data-driven model; Economic aspects; Input variables; Iterative approach; Machine learning techniques; Per capita income; Predictive modeling; Spatial scale; developing world; machine learning; modeling; planning method; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban planning; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; Predictive analytics","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","The research was supported by grants from the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES) and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico—Brasil (CNPq).","Adamowski J., Karapataki C., Comparison of multivariate regression and artificial neural networks for peak urban water-demand forecasting: Evaluation of different ANN learning algorithms, J.

Social distancing policies around the world in response to the pandemic have led to spatio-temporal variations in water consumption and therefore, to changes in the flow of wastewater, creating potential problems in the infrastructure, operation and quality of services. The goal of this work was to examine how these changes and how the pandemic itself affected the characteristics of municipal wastewater. Data on the quantity and quality of municipal wastewater in four settlements of different sizes in the Republic of Serbia in the period from 2015 to 2022 were collected. The data indicated an increase in the amount of wastewater generated in 2020, which may be a consequence of excessive water use. An increase in the mean concentrations of most parameters in 2020 compared to the previous five-year average was also observed. The most significant changes were observed concerning the concentrations of organic matter (2–124%), nitrogen (6–80%), phosphorus (14–91%), suspended matter (8–308%), fats and oils (97–218%) and surfactants (12–110%). Changes in terms of increasing concentrations were also noticed after the peak of the pandemic, i.e., in the period from 2021 to 2022. In addition, an increase in the COD/BOD ratio from around 2 to around 4 in the year 2020 was also observed (COD—Chemical Oxygen Demand; BOD—Biological Oxygen Demand). This is very important and should be taken into account in wastewater treatment procedures in order to achieve high efficiency in the operation of the plant itself. © 2023 by the authors.","characterization; COVID-19; pollution; public policy; wastewater","Serbia; COVID-19; nutrient dynamics; policy making; wastewater treatment; water pollution; water supply","","","","","PROMIS, (6066881); Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia","This research is funded by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia—Program for excellent projects of young researchers—PROMIS (WasteWaterForce Project #6066881).","Listings of WHO’s Response to COVID-19, (2020); Balanza-Martinez V., Atienza-Carbonell B., Kapczinski F., De Boni R.B., Lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19—Time to connect, Acta Psychiatr.

We developed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the effect of people's choice to accept or reject drinking water based on chlorine taste and their subsequent exposure to E. coli and trihalomethanes, a class of disinfection byproduct (DBP). The simulation used empirical data from Dhaka, Bangladesh, a megacity with endemic waterborne disease. We drew on published taste acceptability thresholds from Dhaka residents, measured residual chlorine and thermotolerant E. coli inactivation following the addition of six chlorine doses (0.25–3.0 mg/L as Cl2) to untreated piped water samples from 100 locations, and analyzed trihalomethane formation in 54 samples. A dose of 0.5 mg/L, 75% lower than the 2 mg/L dose typically recommended for household chlorination of low-turbidity waters, minimized overall exposure to E. coli. Doses of 1–2 mg/L maximized overall exposure to trihalomethanes. Accounting for chlorine taste aversion indicates that microbiological exposure increases and DBP exposure decreases above certain doses as a higher proportion of people reject chlorinated water in favor of untreated water. Taken together with findings from other modeling analyses, empirical studies, and field trials, our results suggest that taste acceptability should be a critical consideration in establishing chlorination dosing guidelines. Particularly when chlorination is first implemented in water supplies with low chlorine demand, lower doses than those generally recommended for household water treatment can help avoid taste-related objections while still meaningfully reducing contaminant exposure. © 2021","Bangladesh; Chlorine; Disinfection byproducts (DBPs); Drinking water; Monte Carlo simulation; Taste","Bangladesh; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Halogenation; Humans; Taste; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Supply; Bangladesh; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Escherichia coli; Chlorination; Chlorine; Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Intelligent systems; Potable water; Water supply; chlorine; drinking water; trihalomethane; chlorine; disinfectant agent; trihalomethane; Bangladesh; Chlorinated waters; Disinfection by-product; Disinfection byproduct; Disinfection byproducts; E. coli; Fecal contamination; Monte Carlo's simulation; Taste; Trihalomethanes; chlorination; chlorine; disinfection; drinking water; megacity; Monte Carlo analysis; pollution exposure; simulation; water supply; water treatment; Article; Bangladesh; chlorination; controlled study; environmental exposure; Escherichia coli; feces; fluid intake; household; human; maximum concentration; Monte Carlo method; practice guideline; risk assessment; taste aversion; taste preference; turbidity; water borne disease; water contamination; water disinfection; water quality; water supply; disinfection; Escherichia coli; halogenation; taste; water management; water pollutant; water supply; Monte Carlo methods","","chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; Chlorine, ; Disinfectants, ; Trihalomethanes, ; Water Pollutants, Chemical, ","","","National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure, (EEC-1028968); Stanford Center for South Asia; Stanford King Center for Global Development; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Army Research Office, ARO; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate, NDSEG","This work was supported by the Stanford King Center for Global Development , the Stanford Center for South Asia , the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment REIP program , and the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (grant number EEC-1028968 ).

The gravel-bed flocculator provide a simple and inexpensive design for flocculation in small water treatment plants (less than 5000 m3/day capacity). The packed bed of gravel provides ideal conditions for the formation of compact settleable flocs because of continuous recontact provided by the sinuous flow of water through the interstices formed by the gravel. The field data which were obtained from the operation of the water supply treatment unit cover the physical, chemical and biological water qualities of the raw and settled water as obtained by the operation of the treatment unit. The experiments were carried out with the aim of assessing the efficiency of the gravel filter in removing the turbidity, pathogenic bacteria, from the raw water. The water treatment plant, which was constructed for the treatment of river water, was in principle a rapid sand filter. The results show that the average value of the turbidity level of the settled water was 4.83 NTU with a standard deviation of turbidity 2.893 NTU. This indicated that the removal efficiency of the sedimentation tank (gravel filter) was about 67.8 %. for pH values fluctuated between 7.75 and 8.15, indicating the alkaline nature of the raw water of the river Shatt Al-Hilla, as expected. Raw water pH is depressed slightly following alum coagulation. The pH of the settled water ranged from 7.75 to a maximum of 8.05. The bacteriological tests which were carried out on the water samples were: total coliform test, E-coli test, and the plate count test. In each test the procedure used was as outlined in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, AWWA, and WPCF, 1985). The gravel filter exhibit a low performance in removing bacterial load. The percentage bacterial removal, which is maximum for total plate count (19%) and minimum for total coliform (16.82%).","Gravel bed flocculator; Total coliform; Turbidity","Bacteria; Bacteriology; Coagulation; Flocculation; Gravel; Packed beds; Potable water; Removal; Testing; Turbidity; Wastewater; Water pollution; Water quality; Water supply; Water treatment plants; Alkalinity; Alum coagulation; Average values; Bacterial load; Bacterial removal; Biological water; Drinking water quality; Field data; Gravel bed; Gravel filters; Low costs; Pathogenic bacterium; pH value; Raw water; Removal efficiencies; River water; Sand filter; Sedimentation tank; Standard deviation; Standard method; Total coliform; Total plate count; Treatment units; Water and wastewater; Water samples; Chemical water treatment","","","","","","","Fair G.M., Geyer J.G., Okun D.A., Element of Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal, (1971); Kardile J.N., Crushed Coconut Shell as a New Filter Media for Dual and Multi-Layer Filters, Jour.

A hybrid model is proposed for medium and long-term hydrological forecasting in this paper. The hybrid model consists of two methods, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). In this model, the time series of annual runoff are first decomposed into several sub-series corresponding to some tendentious and periodic motions by using SSA and then each sub-series is predicted, respectively, through an appropriate ARIMA model, and lastly a correction procedure is conducted for the sum of the prediction results to ensure the superposed residual to be a pure random series. The annual runoff data of two reservoirs in China are analyzed as case studies. The results have been compared with the predictions made by ARIMA and Singular Spectrum Analysis-Linear Recurrent Formulae (SSA-LRF). It is shown that hybrid model has the best performance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","ARIMA; Biliuhe reservoir; Dahuofang reservoir; Medium and long-term hydrological forecasting; SSA","China; Dahuofang Reservoir; Liaoning; Absorption spectra; Forecasting; Interferometry; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Time series; ARIMA; Biliuhe reservoir; Dahuofang reservoir; Hydrological forecasting; SSA; forecasting method; numerical model; runoff; spectrum; time series analysis; Spectrum analysis","","","","","Ertan Hydropower Development Company.; National Key Technology R&D Program, (2007BAB28B01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (50579095)","Acknowledgements This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 50579095) & Ertan Hydropower Development Company., LTD, and National Key Technology R&D Program in the 11th Five year Plan of China (No. 2007BAB28B01).

The winery plant considered in this study, located in the Langhe area (Piedmont, NW Italy), used approx.100,000 m3 per year of high quality water for cleaning and sanitation operations. Water was collected from the local shallow aquifer and contained high concentrations of dissolved iron (Fe(II), 800 – 3500 μg/L) and manganese (Mn(II), 300–700 μg/L). The water treatment plant (WTP) owned by the winery included a series of treatment processes (air sparging and sodium hypochlorite injection, settling, filtration on a quartzite – pyrolusite filter, removal of excess chlorine with an activated carbon filter and, finally, microfiltration and reverse osmosis, RO) that were deemed to be adequate to make the groundwater compliant with potable uses. However, a survey carried out by the authors revealed the presence of two critical issues in the WTP's management, concerning the Fe(II) and Mn(II) oxidation and removal, and the backwashing of the dual media filter. Firstly, the results of pilot tests demonstrated that the process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and that NaClO was not necessary for that operation. The present concentration of pure oxidant, of 21.5 mg NaClO/L, could be reduced by at least 75 %, without altering the capacity of the WTP in the removal of the two metals. Secondly, a new combination of water fluxes could improve the efficiency of the dual media filter backwashing, thus allowing to simultaneously avoid the use of the RO corrosive concentrate and to minimize the use of high quality water. In the end, a very basic cost model was used to compare the unit cost for water treatment in the current scenario and after the introduction of the two proposed solutions. Specifically, that model considered three cost items: operating costs (that included four sub-items: mortgage, maintenance, consulting and cost for non-amortizable raw materials and consumable), the costs for the purchase of the chemicals necessary for the water treatment process, and the energy costs. The results coming from the application of the cost model demonstrated that the introduction of the proposed solutions into the WTP, at no additional costs, had an undeniable positive impact on the final unit cost of the treated water, that was reduced by 20 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air sparging; Dual media filtration; Energy consumption; Groundwater treatment; Iron/manganese oxidation; Treatment cost","","","","","","","","Bonamente E., Scrucca F., Asdrubali F., Cotana F., Presciutti A., The water footprint of the wine industry: implementation of an assessment methodology and application to a case study, Sustainability, 7, pp. 12190-12208, (2015); Crowe A., The Water-wise winemaker, Tips, Techniques and Ideas for Saving Water in the Cellar, (2014); Matos C., Pirra A., Water to wine in wineries in Portugal Douro Region: comparative study between wineries with different sizes, Sci.

To address this, a groundwater flow model and several mathematical data-driven models have been developed for forecasting groundwater levels. However, there is a problem of unavailability and scarcity of the on-site input data needed by the data-driven models to forecast the groundwater level. Furthermore, as a result of the dynamics and stochastic characteristics of groundwater, there is a need for an appropriate, accurate and reliable forecasting model to solve these challenges. Over the years, the broad application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are gaining attraction as an alternative solution for forecasting groundwater levels. Against this background, this article provides an overview of forecasting methods for predicting groundwater levels. Also, this article uses ML models such as Regressions Models, Deep Auto-Regressive models, and Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Networks with External Input (NARX) to forecast groundwater levels using the groundwater region 10 at Karst belt in South Africa as a case study. This was done using Python Mx. Version 1.9.1., and MATLAB R2022a machine learning toolboxes. Moreover, the Coefficient of Determination (R2);, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mutual Information gain, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)) models were the forecasting statistical performance metrics used to assess the predictive performance of these models. The results obtained showed that NARX and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have higher performance metrics and accuracy compared to other models used in this study. © 2023","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting model; Groundwater levels; Machine learning; Neural networks; Rainfall; Regression; Temperature; Time series","Errors; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Learning systems; Mean square error; River pollution; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Surface waters; Time series analysis; Case-studies; Data-driven model; Forecasting models; Ground water level; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Regression; South Africa; Times series; Groundwater","","","","","Research Centre of Climate Change, Water Security and Disaster Management of the Tshwane University of Technology; Tshwane University of Technology , Faculty of Engineering; Tshwane University of Technology Pretoria; Tshwane University of Technology, Faculty of Engineering; Water Research Commission, WRC; Tshwane University of Technology, TUT","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the Tshwane University of Technology, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment of the Tshwane University of Technology, the Research Centre of Climate Change, Water Security and Disaster Management of the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, Department of Electrical Engineering/F'SATI of the Tshwane University of Technology Pretoria, and the Water Research Commission (WRC), Pretoria, South Africa for financial support while conducting the research and writing this paper.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the Tshwane University of Technology , Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment of the Tshwane University of Technology, the Research Centre of Climate Change, Water Security and Disaster Management of the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, Department of Electrical Engineering/F'SATI of the Tshwane University of Technology Pretoria, and the Water Research Commission (WRC) , Pretoria, South Africa for financial support while conducting the research and writing this paper.","Samian M., Mahdei K.N., Saadi H., Movahedi R., Identifying factors affecting optimal management of agricultural water, J.
